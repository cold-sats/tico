# GLib 0.18 security backport

The Linux Tauri 2 / GTK 0.18 dependency graph requires GLib `^0.18`. The published
`glib 0.18.5` crate has an unsound variadic output argument in `VariantStrIter`.
The fixed `0.20` series is outside that requirement. The official `0.18` branch
at `42b9caf98e03ded086362d9653ca58fe94dc8658` still contains the vulnerable code.

`glib/` is the complete original MIT-licensed crate from
[`glib-0.18.5.crate`](https://static.crates.io/crates/glib/glib-0.18.5.crate),
SHA-256 `233daaf6e83ae6a12a52055f568f9d7cf4671dabb78ff9560ab6da230ce00ee5`,
with exactly the two source-line changes from
[upstream PR 1343](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/pull/1343):
commit [`b5a4071e439bef2b5eea76c3aa25e5ae84839e34`](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/commit/b5a4071e439bef2b5eea76c3aa25e5ae84839e34),
merged as `05dff0ee696f9bcd8617cd48c4b812d046d440cb`.
The output pointer is mutable and passed as `&mut p` to `g_variant_get_child`.
Original metadata, source, tests and [license](glib/LICENSE) are retained.
`glib-provenance.json` records the original package commit and hashes of every
original file plus the patched source hash.

`app/Cargo.toml` patches crates.io GLib to this local source. The version stays
`0.18.5` and the lockfile records a path package; it does not pretend to be
`0.20`. Version-based scanners may still report
[RUSTSEC-2024-0429 / GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0429.html).
No advisory suppression is installed and this does not claim that Dependabot
will close the alert. Assess the patched source and these tests alongside the
scanner result.

From the repository root, with Rust, Python 3.11+ and native GLib development
headers installed:

```sh
python app/tests/check_glib_backport.py
cargo metadata --manifest-path app/Cargo.toml --offline --locked --format-version 1 --no-deps
cargo tree --manifest-path app/Cargo.toml --offline --locked --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --invert glib
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=app/target/glib-backport cargo test --manifest-path app/tests/glib-backport/Cargo.toml --offline --locked --release --test variant_str_iter
```

The standalone regression uses this same GLib source and real native GLib FFI,
without compiling Tauri or needing a display. Optimization matters: the old
immutable-reference write can be discarded by Rust. The five tests exercise
`next`, `nth`, `last`, `next_back`, `nth_back`, mixed ends, Unicode, empty and
overflowing skips, and borrowed-string lifetime. First populate the public
dependency cache if an offline command reports a missing crate.

When a maintained compatible upstream release/commit contains the fix, replace
the local patch with that reviewed source and regenerate the lockfile. When the
desktop graph supports a fixed GLib series, remove the vendor patch and guard.
Retain the regression until the new dependency has passed the same optimized
checks. Never edit the vendored version to satisfy a scanner or silently update
the integrity manifest with unrelated source changes.
