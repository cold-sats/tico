"""Who owns this environment, who may sign in, and who is on the roster: stored, not configured.

TICO_OWNER_EMAIL and registry/hub-access.yaml only seed the first boot. From then on the owner
and the access list are two revisioned records (like the provider choice in providers.py), so
the owner changes them in the app without editing a file or restarting:

  owner   {email}                                    who holds owner rights
  access  {allowed, allowed_domains, admins,         who may join, who the Admins are (`bot_admins` is
          member_bot_limit}                          the old name, still read and kept in step for
                                                     one release), and how many bots a member may have
                                                     (MEMBER_BOT_LIMIT when unset)

The roster stays the gate for sign-in: a person on it (and not marked as left) is in. An
address on `allowed`, or at an allowed domain, joins the roster on its first verified sign-in.
