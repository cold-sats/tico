"""Who may see, read and write to each bot: three audiences per bot, stored on the bot.

    see    the bot in the org chart and in bot lists: its name, role, who runs it, who it reports to
    read   its activity: tasks, updates, files, status and run log, routines, its shared rooms
    write  send it messages, ask it, give it tasks or notes, comment on its tasks

Each level names an audience: everyone, or lists of people (roster ids), teams (a team name or an
org-chart department) and bots (slugs). `bot_config.access_json` holds the three; NULL means Open
(everyone for all three), which is what every new bot starts with. Whoever may read or write can
see, whatever the See list says. The rules that decide a caller live in `Auth.bot_access`
(backend/auth.py); this module is the pure part: the stored shape and who an audience names.
