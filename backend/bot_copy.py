"""Copy a bot, bring a copy up to date with its original, suggest a copy's changes back, and copy a skill between bots
(docs/creating-bots.md, "Copy a bot").

A copy is an ordinary bot that belongs to whoever asked. Nothing ties it to the original but `copied_from: {bot, sha}` on its
record, which two explicit requests read: update my copy from the original, and suggest this to the original.

The server holds no bot repository (backend/bot_tools.py), so these routes decide and record, and BotOps's computer moves the
files in the workspace (clients/botcopy.py): the route checks the requester's rights, registers the new bot within their
limit, copies the model settings, grants the credentials the requester may grant and answers with what is left to do. A
suggestion to the original is the exception that needs no repository here: the requester's files come in the request and the
GitHub App opens a pull request with them, or, when the requester may not write to the original, a task carries the diff to its
owner. Every route is one BotOps may call as the requester (backend/botops_act.py): the server's own checks are the gate.
