"""Automatic bot KPIs: measures Tico computes from its own data, so no steward is needed.

Each bot has five, and each is a virtual KPI: nothing is stored, the value is worked out when it is
read, and it has an id (`auto:<bot>:<metric>`) that a goal links to like any other KPI, with a target
on the link. Their readings are the same measure at the end of each of the last fourteen days, so a
sparkline and a pace work the way they do for a KPI a person or the Goal Manager keeps.

  tasks_done_7d       tasks the bot owns that were finished in the last seven days
  first_response_min  median minutes from a message to the bot to its first reply in that conversation (7 days)
  approval_rate_30d   the share of its approval requests a person approved, over the last thirty days
  failed_runs_7d      runs that ended failed in the last seven days
  cost_7d             what its runs cost in the last seven days, estimated from their tokens (usage.py); runs on a
                      subscription sign-in are left out

A metric with nothing to measure over its window (no message was sent to it, no approval was decided,
no run recorded a cost) has no reading, and no reading is missing data, never zero.
