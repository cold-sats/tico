"""The anonymous usage count: what an install tells Tico HQ when it looks for a new release.

Read PRIVACY.md first; this module is the whole of it. When counting is on, the release check asks
`GET <TICO_HQ_URL>/v1/latest` with exactly four query fields (`payload()`): a random install id, the
version, and two yes/no flags. Nothing else is sent, and nothing is sent at all while counting is off
(`off_reason()`), when the owner has not yet been shown the notice, or in demo mode. Off means the check
goes straight to GitHub with no id, as it did before this existed.

The id is random, made once, stored in this database and never derived from anything. The flags are
booleans over the last seven days: a person used the app, a bot turn completed.
