"""`hub health check`: what is wrong with the bots this person may see, most urgent first (docs/permissions.md scopes it).

Read from the records the server already holds, per bot: not on a computer, its computer offline, failing runs, a
credential it declares but does not have, setup that never finished, paused (and paused over a limit), quarantined.
Each issue says in a plain sentence what is wrong and the one command that fixes it, so BotOps can fix what it may and
report the rest.
