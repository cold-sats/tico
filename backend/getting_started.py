"""After the wizard: the Getting started checklist, the tour and the market research request.

The checklist is computed from what the database says right now (a runner's last heartbeat, a
bot's row, a finished task), so a step can never be ticked by hand and can never stay ticked
after the thing it names goes away. What a person may do by hand is limited to their own
choices: skipping an optional step, closing the tour, hiding the checklist.
Those live in the person's `preferences` row, so each person has their own.
