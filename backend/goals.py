"""Goals: what every person and bot on the org chart is for, and how it says it is going.

A goal has an owner (a person, a bot, or `company`; one field), the goal it serves (`parent_id`,
optional: a goal with none is simply not linked), and a colour. What level a goal is at comes from
its owner: `company` is a company goal, `human:x` a person's, `bot:x` a bot's. A company goal is
optional. Bots read theirs with `hub goal list`; nothing is pushed into a run.

A goal links to KPIs (backend/kpis.py) and its colour is set automatically from them, by the Goal
Manager, or from its owner's check-ins and its tasks when it has none. A person may override that:
the colour they set sticks (`status_source` is `person`, with their note) until a person hands it
back, and the Goal Manager may only *suggest* a different one. Every colour is stored with who set
it (`status_by`) and how (`status_source`, auto or person), in `goals` and in `goal_events`.

Rows are appended, never deleted: `dropped` is a status. Every change leaves a `goal_events` row, as
`task_events` does for tasks. Changes to a definition or a target that the Goal Manager wants are
proposals (`goal_proposals`) that the goal's or KPI's owner confirms.
