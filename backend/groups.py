"""Groups: how a team is divided into sub-teams (docs/org-chart.md).

A group is an id, a name, an optional parent group and its teammates, humans and bots. Groups nest. There is
no table of their own: the groups are `org_groups` in the roster (`registry_metadata` key `people`), a human is in
the group named by their `team`, and a bot in the one named by `team` in its config. A teammate is in one group at a
time. Who reports to whom (`reports_to`) is a separate thing and is never touched here.

  rows(...)                a group's row: id, name, parent, people, bots
  create / update / delete the changes the API and the tools make
  place(...)               the team builder: bots into the groups of their templates, made if they are not there yet
  migrate(c, settings)     once, for a team that had `teams`, org groups or derived departments: every one becomes a
                           group and every bot its group's member (idempotent; `groups_migrated` in the roster)

Built-in bots (the Assistant, BotOps, the Librarian, the Goal Manager) and helpers stay outside groups.
