"""Keeping a computer's model CLIs current from Settings: Update, Pin to this version, Resume updates.

The owner asks for one action on one harness of one computer; the runner asks the server what is
waiting (the same shape as the browser sign-in relay in model_login.py), applies it between turns
and reports back. Update waits until no running turn uses the harness. Only the owner may ask, and
every request leaves an event.
