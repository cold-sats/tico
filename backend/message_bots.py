"""A message bot is a person's: the server has to be told whose, or its runs get no mail token.

The Inbox Manager template only writes `Mailbox: <email>` into the bot's instructions. What lets a run ask its
computer for a token is the roster: the person's `inbox_bot` names the bot, and the bot's `gmail` tool names the
address (routines.token_mailboxes). `link` writes both wherever a message bot is made (Settings' add from template,
the team builder, BotOps registering one for the person who asked), and `backfill` does it once at start for the
bots made before that, when there is no doubt whose they are.

Where the mailbox is written varies: a `Mailbox:` line, the `gmail` tool in the stored config, the same tool as the
bot's computer reports it from bot.yaml (BotOps writes it there), or plain words in the instructions ("for my mailbox
x@y"). The person is the roster entry with that email when there is one, else the bot's own owner (whoever made it or
asked BotOps for it): a mailbox on the company's Workspace domain is often not the address a person signs in with.
