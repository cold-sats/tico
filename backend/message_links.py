"""Which messages could be about a task, kept per message so a task's page does not read its whole room.

A message's tasks (backend/task_privacy.py `message_tasks`) come from three places: what its own refs
name, its parents' tasks (`in_reply_to`, `refs.answers`, `refs.inputs`), and the run it reports on
(`refs.turn_id`, `refs.run.attempt_id`). The first two are fixed by the row; a run's tasks grow after
the message is written (a carried task, a moved input). So a message keeps its static links here:

  task     a string in its refs that could be a task id
  parent   a message whose tasks it inherits
  attempt  the run whose tasks it inherits

and `candidates` works out the rest at read time (`named`, for a task's comments, needs only the first).
The answer is a superset: the page still checks
every candidate with `message_tasks` and `readable`, so a stale or extra link can only cost a check,
and a missing one would hide a message. To keep links from going missing:

- triggers mark every inserted or re-pointed message dirty in the same statement, whoever writes it;
- `Store.transaction` refreshes the dirty rows before it commits, and `candidates` reads a dirty row's
  links from the row itself, so a write outside `Store.transaction` is still seen;
- `message_links_seen` records every message whose links were worked out, and every start backfills the
  messages missing from it, so rows an older server wrote (a rollback then an upgrade) get their links, even
  where SQLite reused the rowid of a deleted one; until the first full pass has finished a page reads its room.
