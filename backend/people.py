"""Who the humans are, and which of them a bot works for.

`registry/people.yaml` is the roster: the teams, the people, and who is the primary user of each
bot. `registry/employees.yaml` says who reports to whom. Put the two together and every bot has a
team (walk `reports_to` until it reaches a team's root) and a person (whoever claims that team or
that bot in `primary_for`, else `default_user`).

Pure: a parsed document in, decisions out. No files, no network, no clock. `backend/store.py`
reads the YAML and hands the document here; `backend/tests/test_people.py` covers the rules.
