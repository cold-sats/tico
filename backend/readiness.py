"""Can this bot run this runtime on this computer: the one check behind a model change, a move and Health.

    can_run(c, bot, runtime, runner=None, harness="", model="") -> dict

`runner` is a computer id (default: the computer the bot is on). The answer is judged from that computer's last
heartbeat **for this bot**: its own subscription profile's sign-in when it has one, its own API-key Credential for the
runtimes that take a key per bot (Gemini CLI, Pi), and otherwise the computer's shared sign-in for that runtime. Another
bot's missing key or another profile's sign-in never decides it.

    can_run      True, False, or None when nothing says (offline, an older computer, not checked yet, not applicable)
    applicable   False for a bot an external agent runs (Hermes, OpenClaw, Grok Bot): no computer check applies
    problem      one plain sentence when can_run is not True
    fix, link    what the person does and where (a relative `#/...` link), only when can_run is False or the bot has no
                 computer
    computer     {"id", "label"} or None; online
    reported     whether the bot's own readiness row already reflects this runtime (and model): after the next heartbeat
    bot_ready, bot_problems   that row's verdict, which describes the previous runtime until `reported` is true

Callers refuse only on can_run False; None never blocks.
