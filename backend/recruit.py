"""The org builder's suggestions: which bots to recruit into one department (docs/onboarding.md, PRIVACY.md).

The browser never talks to Tico HQ. It asks `POST /api/v2/onboarding/recruit` with a department, the owner's one-line
answer and their "Suggestions from Tico HQ" toggle, and this module answers from one of two places:

- **Tico HQ** (`POST <TICO_HQ_URL>/v1/recruit`), only when the toggle is on *and* the install allows it: not in demo
  mode, not with `TICO_TELEMETRY=off` or `DO_NOT_TRACK`, and not with the anonymous usage count switched off in
  Settings. It sends the department, the answer, three short facts from "About the company" and the catalog version,
  waits at most HQ_TIMEOUT seconds, and keeps only template ids that are in this install's own catalog for that
  department.
- **The local recommender** (backend/recruit_rank.py) otherwise, and on any failure: no network at all.

Either way the answer is template ids and a short "why" per bot, never text a bot would follow.
