"""The org builder's catalog and its local recommender: which bots to suggest for one department.

Standard library only, because the same file runs in two places: the Tico server (backend/recruit.py, the answer when
Tico HQ is off or unreachable) and Tico HQ (hq/recruit.py, the answer when its model is capped or not configured).
`scripts/build_catalog_json.py` copies it to hq/recruit_rank.py and writes hq/catalog.json with `build()`; its `--check`
fails when either copy is stale.

`build(departments, cards)` turns templates/departments.yaml and the card.yaml files (already parsed) into
{version, departments, cards}. `rank(catalog, department, briefing, about)` answers {bots: [{template_id, why}],
suggested_default: [template_id]} with template ids from that department only, never free text a bot would follow.
