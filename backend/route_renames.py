"""The v0.2.21 vocabulary rename of the REST routes, in one place.

Handlers keep registering under the paths they always had. `install(app)` runs once, after every route is
registered, and for each route whose path is in RENAMES it makes the NEW path the canonical route (same endpoint,
methods and response model, in the same position in the route order) and keeps the OLD path as a second route,
marked `deprecated` in OpenAPI. The old spellings answer for one release; then the old routes and this table's
old column go.

Beyond the renames, three routes are new doors onto an existing answer: `GET /health/issues` (the live snapshot
for the Assistant, what is wrong for everyone else), `GET /messages?unread=1` (the inbox) and `GET /archives?source=`
(one archive, where `/archives` alone lists them).

`/runners/*` stays canonical for the runner software's own calls (enroll, heartbeat, desired, assignments, ...):
only `/runners/{id}/...`, what a person does to one computer, moves to `/computers/{id}/...`. The runner-facing
`/connectors/*` routes stay as they are.
