"""Routines: the server's table of recurring work, and what happens when one is due.

A routine is one row in `schedules`: a bot, a time (a cron) or a hub event, a title, and the
text the bot receives. People and bots write rows through the API (`hub routine ...`); the
scheduler reads them. Nothing else defines a routine: not a file in the bot's repository, not
a Git branch. When one is due the hub opens a task for the bot with that text, and the bot
takes it from there like any other task.
