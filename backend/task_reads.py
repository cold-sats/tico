"""Task lists that cost only what changed.

A board re-read every two minutes, on waking and on reconnecting loaded every task it shows to
find that almost none had moved. Two things make a re-read cheap:

- **A cursor and a delta read.** Every task list answer carries `cursor`: the change number
  (backend/events.py) it was read at, and a tag of what the reader may see, as one opaque string.
  `GET /api/v2/tasks?changed_after=<cursor>` with the same filters looks up only the tasks the
  change log names since then (and the tasks that show them: a parent's progress, a relation's
  other end) and answers `tasks` (changed and still matching), `gone` (ids that changed and no
  longer match: deleted, no longer readable by the caller, or out of the filters) and a new
  `cursor`. A cursor older than the log keeps (24 h), ahead of it, malformed, read with different
  access (a grant, a team or a bot's access changed), or naming more changes than a page holds
  (or one change to many tasks, such as a type edit) answers `reset: true`, the events stream's
  word for it, and the client reads in full.
- **ETags.** A full read of tasks or labels is tagged with the newest task change, the reader's
  access, the display names and the query; routines with their rows. A matching `If-None-Match`
  is answered 304 with no body before any task row is loaded.

`gone` never names a task the caller could not have read: the log keeps a task's earlier parties
and privacy on the change that altered them (and on its deletion), and an id is reported only when
the caller could read the task now, or could under one of those earlier states.
