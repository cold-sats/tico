"""Who is on a task, by role.

Besides its owner, any number of people or bots can be on a task, each under a role: a row of
`task_roles` (`task_id`, `role`, `actor`). A role is a short name the team chooses (`developer`,
`reviewer`, `qa`, `designer`); Tico keeps no list of them and gives them no meaning or rights. A
person may hold several roles on one task, and the owner may hold any of them too. What a role
means downstream (which column waits on whom, a dependency monitor) is the client's to decide.

`set_roles` is the only writer (task update and create, the task page, `hub task update --role`,
the MCP tools). Whoever may change the task's other fields may change who is on it.

This module imports nothing from hubdb at load, so hubdb can import it; the writer reaches hubdb
through `_H()`.
