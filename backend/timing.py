"""Where a request's time goes (is it the backend or the frontend?).

Per route, the last 300 requests: how long signing in took (it waits for a worker thread) and how
long the whole answer took on the server. Also how late the event loop wakes up (a blocked loop
delays every request) and how many requests are in flight. Numbers only: no paths with ids, no
bodies, no people. `GET /api/v2/ops/timing` reads it; every answer carries `Server-Timing`.
