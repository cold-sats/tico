"""What a bot's turn did, for the chat under its reply (#524).

A reply carries `refs.turn_id`, its attempt. `annotate` adds two things a person reading the room
may see: the titles of the tasks a message refers to, and `run` on a reply: the hub work the turn
did while it ran (tasks handed out, links filed, questions and messages sent, refusals) and the
size of its work (steps, tool calls, time). `GET /api/v2/turns/{id}/steps` is that work line by
line, read when someone opens it. Everything is read from what the hub already records; a row
the reader could not open on its own (a task or a conversation outside their reach) is left out.
