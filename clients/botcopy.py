"""Copying a bot, and copying a skill, on the computer that holds the bot repositories.

The server holds no bot repository (backend/bot_tools.py), so the files are BotOps's to move, in the workspace,
once the server has said the requester may (backend/bot_copy.py): it checks the rights, registers the new bot and
grants credentials; this module makes the repository and the commits.

A copy is a fresh repository with one commit: the original's files at the commit it was at, not its history.
Nothing is linked afterwards except `copied_from: {bot, sha}` on the server, which "update from the original" and
"suggest to the original" read. Both work on the instructions only (`AGENT.md`, `skills/`, `playbooks/`), file by file,
with `git merge-file` for the three-way merge.

Secrets never travel: dotenv files, `secrets/`, key files and credentials are left out whatever else is asked.
