"""The bot catalog: the templates a company picks its bots from, and how one becomes a repository.

A card (`templates/catalog/<template>/card.yaml`) says what a bot is for, what it owns, what it
never does, and whether the runner may set it up itself (`bootstrap: true`, which is the
assistant and BotOps, because BotOps cannot create itself). Everything else in the folder is the
repository a new bot starts from — AGENT.md, bot.yaml, playbooks, knowledge, memory — with
`{{company_name}}`, `{{app_name}}`, `{{assistant_name}}` and `{{bot_name}}` standing in for what
this installation calls itself and this bot.

Pure: no HTTP, no database, no launchd. The runner materializes the two bootstrap bots before
their first turn (runner/service.py); BotOps materializes every other chosen bot inside a turn
with `hub bot create` (clients/hubcli.py), and an operator can do it by hand with
`scripts/tico -e <env> bot create <slug> --template <template>`. `TICO_CATALOG_DIR` overrides
where the cards are read from, so a test or a second checkout can hold its own.
