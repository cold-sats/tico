"""A bot's remote MCP servers: the `mcp:` blocks of its `tools:` entries (docs/connect-tools.md), read once
here for the runner's hosts, its readiness report and the reachability check.

An entry looks like

    - service: linear
      mcp: {url: "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp", transport: http, headers: {Authorization: "Bearer ${LINEAR_API_KEY}"}}
      can: [read, write]
      env: LINEAR_API_KEY

The only placeholder a header may use is that entry's own `env` variable (`access_entry.clean_mcp`), and
it is filled only from the environment of this bot's run: what its own secrets, a credential profile and a
grant from the credential vault put there. Nothing else of the runner's environment is ever read into a
header. A server whose variable is not in the run is left out and named in `problems`, never sent half
configured. Where a harness reads `${VAR}` itself (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex's env-based headers) the
placeholder goes through untouched, so no value is written to a file or a command line.

Pure stdlib, like the rest of clients/.
