"""Watchers: a program in a bot's repository that the runner runs on a schedule with no model (docs/watchers.md).

`employee.yaml` declares them:

    watchers:
      - name: hq-tickets
        run: software/hq-tickets watch
        every: 5m
        timeout: 60s          # optional; 60s by default, 5m at most

This module is the one place the declaration is read, shared by the runner and by `hub` checks, and the one place the
output protocol is parsed. It does no I/O of its own.

A watcher prints ordinary lines (a log) and lines that start with `tico-event ` followed by one JSON object:

    tico-event {"op": "task", "key": "hq:TK-AB12CD34", "title": "Support: ...", "body": "..."}
    tico-event {"op": "comment", "key": "hq:TK-AB12CD34", "ref": "msg:7", "text": "..."}
    tico-event {"op": "done", "key": "hq:TK-AB12CD34", "note": "closed at HQ"}

`task` opens a task for the bot if the key has none (once, however often it is printed). `comment` adds a note to that
task and wakes the bot; when the task is finished or closed it opens a new one from `title` and `body`. `done` tells
the bot the thing ended elsewhere. `ref` makes a `comment` idempotent.
