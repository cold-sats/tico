"""Who may act as which mailbox, and with which verbs.

The answer is `bot.yaml` (older: `employee.yaml`), nothing else. `tools:` entries (older: `access:`) with service `gmail` or
`google-calendar` name an identity (the mailbox) and the verbs allowed on it
(hub policies/access.md). Not listed means not allowed, and refusing is exit 2.

The owner is a special identity: `--as <owner handle>` holds every verb on every mailbox, because the owner is the
human using the same CLI interactively.

Two things beyond the declared verbs, both deliberate and documented in docs/mail.md:
  - `read` also allows labelling, archiving, marking read, and starring *inside* the mailbox,
    unless that gmail entry sets `read_only: true`.
    Moving a message between folders is not a send; nothing leaves the company.
  - `draft` and `send` are recorded here for stage 2; stage 1 never writes an outbound message.
