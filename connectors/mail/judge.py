"""The judge for mail: judge the listing before a thread is opened, and gate a draft before the reviewer.

Both read a question set from the hub's `questions/` (`mail-triage`, `mail-draft-gate`) and make
the one call every bot has (`clients/judge.py`): inside a bot turn through the hub with the
turn's own credential, so the key stays on the server and the call is audited there; with a
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` of its own, directly; with neither, not at all, and the pass runs the way it
did before. `MAIL_DECISIONS=none` (formerly `MAIL_JUDGE`) switches it off, which is what the tests set.

Nothing here changes a label, archives a message or writes a draft. A judgment is one line on
the brief listing and one field in the JSON, plus a one-word suggestion computed here from the
set's thresholds, so the rule "what the answers do" is written once and read by every inbox
bot. The bot still opens the threads it acts on and still decides; under the thresholds the
suggestion is `read`, which means what it meant yesterday.

The draft gate is advisory: its flags are recorded with the draft and printed, and the second
reviewer keeps the last word. A month of `gate` audit lines beside the reviewer's verdicts is
how that stays or changes (docs/mail-service.md).
