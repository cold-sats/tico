"""The hub's Gmail labels.

Labels are how a bot's state is visible in Gmail: the owner can see what a bot touched, and undo
it by relabelling. Names are fixed here so no prompt can invent one.

  hub/triaged/<slug>   this employee has looked at it and settled it
  hub/drafted          a reply is waiting in Drafts (stage 2)
  hub/needs-owner      a human has to decide
  hub/handled/<slug>   this employee did the thing
  hub/marketing        bulk mail, archived by the rules
  hub/notification     machine mail, archived by the rules
  hub/noise            everything else that is not worth a human
