"""The deterministic lint. Every rule has a stable id, a severity, and a one-line fix.

Pure: text in, findings out. No network, no Google, no model. `mail lint` runs it standalone and
`draft`, `reply` and `send` run it inside themselves - errors block, warnings are recorded in the
audit line. A rule id never changes meaning, because playbooks and Issues quote them.

    id    severity  what it catches
    L001  error     a forbidden phrase (docs/company.md "What we are not")
    L010  error     a URL on a host that is not acme.example
    L011  error     a forbidden URL (calendly, go.acme.example/get-demo, S3, presigned)
    L012  error     the body carries a link and none of them is the employee's required CTA
    L020  error     a placeholder survived ({{ }}, [NAME], TODO, XXX, lorem ipsum, <insert)
    L030  error     something shaped like a secret (xoxb-, AKIA, sk-, ghp_, -----BEGIN)
    L040  error     internal leakage (s3://, runtime/, emp-, AGENT.md)
    L041  warn      what looks like a hub Issue reference (#123)
    L050  error     no subject, and this is not a reply
    L051  error     the subject is over 120 characters
    L052  error     the body is under 20 characters
    L053  error     the body is over 2500 characters
    L054  error     more than 3 exclamation marks
    L055  error     no signature (none of the last lines names the owner)
    L056  error     more than one external recipient
    L060  error     fewer than two times offered (skipped with --slot: that is a confirmation)
    L061  error     the times offered are not in chronological order
    L062  error     a time offered is in the past
    L063  error     a time offered is not a weekday
    L064  error     a time offered is outside 08:00-18:00 America/Los_Angeles
    L065  error     a time offered does not name its time zone
    L066  error     a time offered is not free (--check-calendar, 30-minute buffer)
    L067  error     confirmation language with no invite (no --slot)
    L070  error     a reply without --reply-to
    L071  error     the recipient is not on the thread being replied to

L041 is the only warning: an inbound thread about "invoice #4471" is a real customer sentence,
so it is recorded rather than blocking, and the owner can see it in the audit. Everything else is a
policy breach, a leak, or a scheduling promise the calendar cannot keep.

Two rules are deliberately narrower than they first look, because the wider version would block
mail the playbooks require. L012 only fires when the body has a link at all - the "reply to a no"
script carries none, and forcing a CTA into it would be wrong. L060 only fires without --slot -
one time in an offer is a mistake, one time in a confirmation is the point.
