# Databases

Bots often need a number that lives in your own database: orders this week, signups by
region, tickets waiting. `hub db` lets a bot ask for it with one read-only statement, without the
server or the bot ever holding a writable password. PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB (Atlas) and
SQLite files work out of the box; BigQuery and Snowflake are covered at the end.

```bash
hub db list                                             # what this bot may use
hub db warehouse "SELECT status, count(*) FROM orders GROUP BY 1"
hub db warehouse --query revenue-by-month --param start=2026-01-01 --param end=2026-07-01
hub db atlas find orders '{"status": "paid"}' --limit 20        # MongoDB: see "MongoDB Atlas" below
```

(`hub sql` is a different thing: read-only SQL over Tico's own database, [hub-sql.md](hub-sql.md).)

## Where it runs, and why

`hub db` runs on the computer that runs the bot, inside the run, not on the Tico server. The
connection string is a credential that lives on that computer (or is delivered to it for one run from the
credential vault); the server never sees it, so the server cannot leak it and a compromised server
cannot query your database. The server still does two jobs: it authenticates the caller, and it
keeps the audit trail and serves the named queries. It cannot run the query for you, and
there is no `hub_db` tool on the server's MCP endpoint for that reason.

Layers, in order of strength (MongoDB has its own list under [MongoDB Atlas](#mongodb-atlas)):

1. **The database role**: a user that can only `SELECT`. This is the real boundary.
2. **The session**: opened read-only (`BEGIN READ ONLY` on PostgreSQL, `SET SESSION TRANSACTION
   READ ONLY` on MySQL, `mode=ro` plus an authorizer on SQLite), so a role that was granted too
   much still cannot write through `hub db`.
3. **The statement**: one `SELECT`, `WITH`, `VALUES`, `SHOW` or `EXPLAIN`; no `INTO`, no second
   statement. This turns mistakes into clear messages; do not rely on it alone.
4. **Limits**: a row cap (default 500, ceiling 10,000) and a statement timeout (default 20 s,
   ceiling 120 s). A result that hit the cap says `truncated`.
5. **The grant**: the bot must declare the database under `tools:` in its `bot.yaml`.
6. **The audit**: each query is recorded in Tico as a `db.query` event (statement, row count,
   time, parameter names; never a value or a row) before the rows are shown. If Tico cannot
   record it the result is withheld.
7. **Redaction**: the connection string and its password are scrubbed from every error.

## Set up in five steps

### 1. Create a read-only user

Do this on a replica if you have one (see Security). Use a long random password.

PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE ROLE tico_readonly LOGIN PASSWORD 'generate-a-long-random-one';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE app TO tico_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO tico_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO tico_readonly;
-- Tables created later, by the role that creates them (repeat per owner):
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE app_owner IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO tico_readonly;
ALTER ROLE tico_readonly SET default_transaction_read_only = on;
ALTER ROLE tico_readonly SET statement_timeout = '30s';
ALTER ROLE tico_readonly CONNECTION LIMIT 5;
-- Keep personal columns out of reach by granting columns instead of the table:
--   REVOKE SELECT ON customers FROM tico_readonly;
--   GRANT SELECT (id, plan, region, created_at) ON customers TO tico_readonly;
```

MySQL and MariaDB:

```sql
CREATE USER 'tico_readonly'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'generate-a-long-random-one' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT SELECT ON app.* TO 'tico_readonly'@'10.%';
-- Or column by column: GRANT SELECT (id, plan, region, created_at) ON app.customers TO 'tico_readonly'@'10.%';
```

(MariaDB: `CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED BY '...'` then `GRANT ...`, and set `max_user_connections`
with `GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO ... WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5`.) Restrict the host to the network
your runner computers are on.

SQLite: nothing to create; give the owner's user read access to the file. `hub db` opens it
`mode=ro`.

### 2. Put the connection string on the computer

The name is `DB_<NAME>_URL` for a database you will call `<name>` (`warehouse` gives
`DB_WAREHOUSE_URL`; a `-` becomes `_`). In the runner's credentials folder, mode 600, never in git:

```
# <workspace>/secrets/_shared.env  (every bot on this computer can receive it; the grant in step 3 decides who may use it)
DB_WAREHOUSE_URL=postgresql://tico_readonly:PASSWORD@replica.internal:5432/app?sslmode=require
# <workspace>/secrets/<bot>.env   (only that bot)
# DB_WAREHOUSE_URL=op://Team Bots/Warehouse read only/url          (a 1Password reference works too)
```

Formats: `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require`, `mysql://user:pass@host:3306/db`
(`?ssl=true` or `?ssl_ca=/path/ca.pem` for TLS), `sqlite:////absolute/path/data.db`. Percent-encode
special characters in a password (`@` is `%40`).

Alternatively store it in **Settings, Credentials** with the environment name `DB_WAREHOUSE_URL`
and grant it to the bots that need it ([credential-vault.md](credential-vault.md)); it reaches the
bot's environment for the length of a run, and the access entry says `vault: hub`.

### 3. Grant bots

Add a `tools:` entry to each bot's `bot.yaml` ([creating-bots.md](creating-bots.md),
"Access and credentials"). Not listed means not allowed, and the owner decides:

```yaml
tools:
  - service: postgres            # postgres | mysql | sqlite
    identity: read-only role on the reporting replica
    database: warehouse          # the name after `hub db`
    can: [read]
    env: DB_WAREHOUSE_URL        # optional; this is the default for `warehouse`
    max_rows: 200                # optional: lower this bot's row cap
    timeout_seconds: 10          # optional: lower this bot's timeout
    note: "revenue reporting only; counts, no customer rows"
```

A bot without the entry is refused even when the credential sits in `_shared.env`. A human who
runs `hub db` from their own shell (with their personal API token, see
[how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md)) is granted by having the connection string in their own
environment.

### 4. Add the database's page and its named queries

Named queries are statements humans already trust, so a bot picks `revenue-by-month`
instead of inventing SQL. They belong to your team, not to Tico: put them in your
[private team config](#a-private-team-config), not in this repository.

`integrations/warehouse.md` describes the database for bots (what it holds, which columns are
personal data, gotchas) in the format every tool page has ([integrations/README.md](../integrations/README.md));
`integrations/queries/warehouse.yaml` lists queries as `{id, title, description, category, tags,
database, sql, params}`. Bind parameters as `:name`; `$1`, `$2` also work and mean the params in the
order listed. A full example for a fictional team is in
[templates/company-config/](../templates/company-config/). The page and query file are named after the
database (`warehouse`), so `hub tool query-search warehouse revenue` searches and `hub db warehouse --query
<id>` runs.

### 5. Test with the doctor

```bash
hub db doctor warehouse
```

It checks the grant, that the credential is set, that it connects, that the session is read-only,
and whether the role can write to any table (a warning names the fix). Run it as a bot by asking
the bot to run it in a run, or as yourself:

```bash
export HUB_API_URL=https://tico.acme.example HUB_TOKEN=tico_pt_...      # a personal API token
export DB_WAREHOUSE_URL='postgresql://tico_readonly:...@replica.internal:5432/app'
hub db doctor warehouse
```

## MongoDB Atlas

`hub db` also reads MongoDB, and MongoDB Atlas is the case it is built for. A bot cannot send SQL or
a command: it picks one of five operations and passes Extended JSON.

```bash
hub db atlas collections                                         # collections, with field names and types from a sample
hub db atlas find orders '{"status": "paid"}' --projection '{"total": 1}' --sort '{"placed_at": -1}' --limit 20
hub db atlas aggregate orders '[{"$match": {"status": "paid"}}, {"$group": {"_id": "$region", "n": {"$sum": 1}}}]'
hub db atlas count orders '{"status": "paid"}'
hub db atlas distinct orders status ['{"region": "eu"}']
hub db atlas --query signups-since --param since=2026-09-01       # a named query (step 4 below)
```

Input is Extended JSON in its relaxed form: plain JSON plus `{"$oid": "..."}` and
`{"$date": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z"}`. Output is the same, one document per line, then `N documents (M ms)`;
`--json` prints the full result. Dates are read as UTC.

### Layers for MongoDB

1. **The Atlas user**: the built-in `read` role on one database. This is the real boundary.
2. **The tool**: five operations only; `$out`, `$merge` and the JavaScript operators `$where`,
   `$function` and `$accumulator` are refused at any depth of a filter or pipeline (a `$unionWith` or
   `$lookup` sub-pipeline too), as are `system.*` collections and `$currentOp`-style stages. This holds
   even if the user was given a write role by mistake, and turns a mistake into a clear message.
3. **Read preference**: `secondaryPreferred` by default, so reads go to a secondary when there is one.
   Change it per bot with `read_preference:` in the `tools:` entry, or `?readPreference=` in the URL.
4. **Limits**: `maxTimeMS` (default 20 s, ceiling 120 s) on every operation and a cap on documents
   (default 500, ceiling 10,000; an aggregation gets a `$limit` appended on the server). A result that
   hit the cap says `truncated`.
5. **The doctor**: asks Atlas which privileges the user holds (`connectionStatus` with
   `showPrivileges`) and warns when any is a write action, or when the role reaches other databases.
6. **The audit and the grant**, as for the other databases.

### 1. Create the Atlas user and the network path

In the Atlas UI, in the project that holds the cluster:

1. **Security, Database & Network Access, Database Access, Add New Database User.**
2. Authentication method **Password**; set a username (`tico_readonly`) and a long random password
   (Autogenerate Secure Password, copy it now).
3. **Database User Privileges**: do not pick a built-in role such as **Only read any database**
   (it reaches every database) and clear any role Atlas preselects. Expand **Specific Privileges**,
   click **Add Specific Privilege**, choose the role **read** and enter your database (for example
   `app`), collection empty. This is the built-in `read` role on that one database.
4. **Restrict Access to Specific Clusters/Data Lakes**: turn it on and select only this cluster.
5. Leave **Temporary User** off (a temporary user stops working when it expires), then **Add User**.

The same with the [Atlas CLI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/) (`--role` is
`roleName@database`; `--scope` limits the user to the named cluster):

```bash
atlas dbusers create --username tico_readonly --password "$TICO_RO_PASSWORD" --role read@app --scope Cluster0 --projectId <project-id>
```

Network access, in one of two ways:

- **IP access list** (the simple way): **Security, Database & Network Access, Network Access, Add IP
  Address** and enter the runner computer's public egress IP as a single address (`203.0.113.7/32`),
  with a comment saying which runner it is. CLI: `atlas accessLists create 203.0.113.7/32 --type cidrBlock --comment "tico runner" --projectId <project-id>`.
  Give the runner a stable egress IP (an Elastic IP or a NAT gateway) or the entry goes stale.
  **Do not use `0.0.0.0/0` ("Allow access from anywhere")**: it puts the cluster's login on the whole
  internet and leaves a password as the only barrier. Use a temporary entry for a first test only and
  delete it.
- **Private endpoint** (better, for runners in AWS, Azure or Google Cloud): **Network Access, Private
  Endpoint**, create the endpoint for the runner's VPC, and use the *private-endpoint* connection
  string Atlas shows for it (`mongodb+srv://...-pri.xxxxx.mongodb.net`). Nothing is opened to the internet.

### 2. Put the SRV connection string on the computer

In **Atlas, Database, Connect, Drivers**, copy the `mongodb+srv://` string and add the password, the
database name in the path and `authSource=admin`:

```
# <workspace>/secrets/_shared.env  (mode 600, never in git)
DB_ATLAS_URL=mongodb+srv://tico_readonly:PASSWORD@cluster0.ab1cd.mongodb.net/app?authSource=admin&retryWrites=false
```

The name follows the same rule as for the SQL databases (`atlas` gives `DB_ATLAS_URL`). The path
database (`/app`) is required: it is the database the operations run on. For a host under
`mongodb.net` the tool sets `authSource=admin` if the URL does not say (Atlas users live in `admin`).
`mongodb+srv://` turns TLS on and reads the cluster's hosts from DNS, so the runner needs working DNS
for SRV and TXT records. Percent-encode special characters in the password (`@` is `%40`). A
self-managed replica set works too: `mongodb://user:pass@host1:27017,host2:27017/app?replicaSet=rs0&tls=true`.

### 3. Grant bots

```yaml
tools:
  - service: mongodb
    identity: Atlas user with the read role on app
    database: atlas              # the name after `hub db`
    can: [read]
    env: DB_ATLAS_URL            # optional; this is the default for `atlas`
    max_rows: 200                # optional: lower this bot's document cap
    timeout_seconds: 10          # optional: lower this bot's maxTimeMS
    read_preference: secondaryPreferred   # optional; the default
    note: "product analytics: counts and groups, no email addresses"
```

### 4. Named queries for MongoDB

A query entry has `mongo:` where a SQL entry has `sql:`: an `op` (`find`, `aggregate`, `count`,
`distinct`), the `collection` and a `filter`, `pipeline` (or `field`, for `distinct`), plus the
usual `params`. A value comes from a parameter as `{"$param": "name"}`:

```yaml
- id: signups-since
  title: Signups since a date
  category: growth
  tags: [signups]
  database: atlas
  mongo:
    op: count
    collection: accounts
    filter:
      created_at: {$gte: {$param: since}}
      plan: {$param: plan}
  params:
  - {name: since, type: date, label: Since, required: true}
  - {name: plan, type: text, label: Plan, required: false, default: team}
```

The placeholder replaces a whole value in the parsed document with a typed value (`text`, `int`,
`number`, `bool`, `date`, `objectid`, `list`); it is never pasted into JSON text, so a value such as
`{"$ne": null}` stays one string and cannot become an operator. A text value that starts with `$` is
refused, since inside a pipeline it would be read as a field path. The server checks the entry when
the query file loads (op, collection, every `$param` declared). The full example is
[templates/company-config/integrations/queries/atlas.yaml](../templates/company-config/integrations/queries/atlas.yaml).

### 5. Test with the doctor

```bash
hub db doctor atlas
```

It checks the grant, the credential, that it connects (and the server version), the read preference,
and the user's privileges. `WARN role privileges: roles readWrite@app allow writes (insert, update, ...)`
means the Atlas user is not the read-only one you meant to create; fix it in Atlas, not here.

### What the audit records for MongoDB

Tico gets the operation, the collection, the shape of the call and the number of documents:
`find accounts {"filter":{"email":"<string>","age":{"$gt":"<number>"}}}`. Every value in a call the
bot wrote is replaced by its type, so an email address, a name or an id someone looked up never lands
in the audit, which anyone who can read events sees. Field names and operators are kept, since they
are what a review needs ("who looked at `email`"), so do not put personal data in a field name. A
named query is the exception on purpose: its entry is reviewed text in your team's queries, so the
audit records the entry with `{"$param": ...}` left in and the parameter names, never their values.

### MongoDB troubleshooting

| You see | Usually |
|---|---|
| `srv_dns` | the host is misspelled, the cluster was deleted, or the runner's DNS resolver refuses SRV/TXT queries (some corporate resolvers do). Try `dig SRV _mongodb._tcp.cluster0.ab1cd.mongodb.net` on the runner; use another resolver, or Atlas's standard (non-SRV) string from the Connect dialog |
| `unreachable` (no server answered in 10 s) | the runner's public IP is not on the IP access list (check the address the runner really egresses from: `curl https://checkip.amazonaws.com`), the cluster is paused, or the private endpoint is not reachable from this computer |
| `tls` | the system clock is off, the CA bundle is missing or old, or a proxy re-signs TLS. Atlas needs TLS 1.2 or newer |
| `auth` | wrong user or password, the password is not percent-encoded, or `authSource` is not `admin` for an Atlas user |
| `read_only ... not authorized` | the collection is outside the user's role (the `read` role is per database) |
| `timeout` | add a `$match` on an indexed field or a date window, or raise `timeout_seconds` (ceiling 120 s) |
| `url: ... database in its path` | put the database in the string: `.../app?authSource=admin` |
| `driver: the mongodb driver is not installed` | `pip install 'pymongo>=4.10' dnspython` in the runner's environment; both are in `backend/requirements.txt` |

## Security guidance

- **Use a replica** when you can: a mistake in a query then costs the replica, not production. A
  bot's `max_rows` and `timeout_seconds` protect the server, but a replica is the real bulkhead.
- **Least privilege**: `SELECT` on the tables the bots need and nothing else, no superuser, no
  `CREATE`, a connection limit. Doctor warns when the role can write.
- **Personal data**: bots read what the role can read, and what a bot reads can end up in a
  task, a message or a memory file. Grant columns instead of tables, or expose a view that hides
  emails, phones and addresses, and say in the database's page which columns are off limits. The
  audit records the statement, so a review can see who asked for what.
- **Prompt injection**: text in the database (a customer note, a ticket body) is data, not
  instructions, and a bot that reads it can be told to do things. Keep the credential read-only
  so the worst outcome is a read the role allowed anyway, keep personal columns out of the role,
  and keep the rule "counts and ids, not rows of humans" on the database's page.
- **The statement checks are not a sandbox.** They catch the common mistake; a database
  function with side effects is only stopped by the role and the read-only session.
- **Never share a writable URL** with a bot, and do not put the connection string in a repository,
  a task or a chat. Rotate the password by changing it in step 1 and step 2; nothing in Tico
  needs to change.

## Troubleshooting

| You see | Usually |
|---|---|
| `grant: ... does not declare database` | the bot's `bot.yaml` has no `tools:` entry with `database: <name>` (step 3) |
| `credential: DB_X_URL is not set` | step 2: wrong file, wrong name, or the bot's computer is not the one holding it |
| `driver: the postgres driver is not installed` | `pip install 'psycopg[binary]'` (MySQL: `PyMySQL`) in the runner's environment; both are in `backend/requirements.txt` |
| `timeout` | add a date window or an index, or lower the work; the limit is 20 s unless the entry raises `timeout_seconds` (ceiling 120 s) |
| `read_only` | the statement wrote, or used `INTO`. `hub db` never writes |
| `refused: one statement per call` | remove the second statement; a trailing `;` is fine |
| `audit: ... result is withheld` | Tico could not record the query; check the runner can reach Tico and retry |
| connection refused / timed out | the database's firewall or security group does not allow the runner computer, or a VPN is down |
| `password authentication failed` | wrong password, or special characters not percent-encoded |
| `SSL` errors | add `?sslmode=require` (PostgreSQL) or `?ssl=true` (MySQL); a private CA needs `ssl_ca` |
| `prepared statement ... does not exist` behind a pooler | use the pooler's session mode, or the database's direct endpoint |
| `srv_dns: the SRV record ... could not be resolved` | MongoDB: a typo in the cluster host, the runner's DNS blocking SRV/TXT lookups, or a paused/deleted cluster; see [MongoDB Atlas](#mongodb-atlas) |
| `unreachable: no server answered within 10 s` | MongoDB: the runner's public IP is not on the Atlas IP access list, or the cluster is paused |
| `auth: authentication failed` | MongoDB: wrong Atlas user or password (percent-encode it), or `authSource` is not `admin` |
| `tls: the TLS handshake failed` | MongoDB: a wrong system clock, an old or missing CA bundle, or a proxy that intercepts TLS |
| result says `truncated` | more rows exist than the cap; add a `WHERE` or `LIMIT`, or aggregate |

## A private team config

Tico's repository is the product. Your team's own material (roster, skills, tool pages,
query files, playbooks) stays in a repository of your own, layered over an upstream release:

```
company-config/                    # a private git repository
  registry/                        # becomes the server's TICO_REGISTRY_DIR
    employees.yaml  people.yaml  hub-access.yaml  ...
    integrations/                  # layered over the release's integrations/
      warehouse.md
      queries/warehouse.yaml
  bot-<slug>/                      # one repository per bot (bot.yaml `tools:`, instructions)
  skills/                          # team skills your bots read
```

**How layering works.** The server reads the release's `integrations/` first, then your team's
directory: `<TICO_REGISTRY_DIR>/integrations` by default, or the directory named by
`TICO_INTEGRATIONS_DIR`. A team page replaces a release page of the same name (your `postgres.md`
would replace the generic one); a team `queries/<service>.yaml` replaces that service's
queries; a page with no queries keeps the one it had. Queries with no page, or a malformed file, are an error that
surfaces on the Tools page rather than being skipped silently. The files are read once per
process, so restart the server after a change.

**Deploying to the server.**

- Docker: the registry is `/data/registry` on the `tico-data` volume. Copy the files in and restart:
  ```bash
  docker compose cp company-config/registry/integrations/. server:/data/registry/integrations/
  docker compose restart server
  ```
  A bind mount (`./company-registry:/data/registry`) in a `compose.override.yaml` also works and
  lets `git pull` be the deploy.
- Linux VM install: `rsync -a company-config/registry/ /var/lib/tico/registry/` (the directory
  `TICO_REGISTRY_DIR` names), then `sudo systemctl restart tico-server`.
- Local environment on a Mac: the environment's `registry/` folder
  ([environments.md](environments.md)), then `scripts/tico -e <slug> server restart`.

**Deploying to the runners.** A runner needs three things and no query files:

1. The Tico release (`hub`, `clients/dbquery.py`), which is what the runner already runs.
2. Each bot's repository with its `bot.yaml` `tools:` entries: that is the grant.
3. `secrets/` on the computer with the `DB_<NAME>_URL` values, kept out of git and out of the
   config repository.

Named queries reach the runner over Tico's API at query time (`hub db <name> --query <id>` asks
the server for the statement), so a query update is a server deploy only.

**What stays upstream.** Tool pages for the services Tico has built-in support for, `hub db`, the driver setup and this
guide. What belongs in your config is anything with a team name, host, table or human in it.
Do not send upstream pull requests that contain them.

## BigQuery, Snowflake and other warehouses

`hub db` speaks PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB and SQLite. For a warehouse with its own CLI, keep the
same shape by hand: credentials in the runner's credential files, a read-only role or service account,
a bot `tools:` entry, and a tool page in your private config saying how to call the CLI.
Examples: `bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --maximum_bytes_billed=1000000000 --format=csv 'SELECT ...'`
(a service account with only `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` and `roles/bigquery.jobUser`, and a
billing cap) or `snowsql -o friendly=false -o output_format=csv -q 'SELECT ...'` (a role with only
`SELECT` on a warehouse with a resource monitor). Snowflake and Redshift accept a PostgreSQL-like
URL only in some setups; if yours does, `postgresql://` may work through `hub db` directly, but test
it with `hub db doctor` first. A dedicated driver adapter for either is a good upstream contribution:
add a `run_<kind>` next to the others in `clients/dbquery.py` with its own read-only session.
