# Glossary

The words Tico uses, and what each replaces.

## Who is on the team

- **Tico**: the product.
- **Team**: everyone, humans and bots. The sidebar section is **Team** and the chart is the team chart.
- **Group**: part of the team. A group can hold groups.
- **Teammate**: a human or a bot on the team.
- **Human**: a human teammate. The **Humans** page lists them.
- **Bot**: an AI teammate.
- **Built-in**: a bot that comes with Tico, serves everyone and belongs to no group: Assistant, BotOps, Librarian, Goal Manager. These four appear as **Built-in** in Settings > Bots. Assistant and BotOps have main rail entries; the Goal Manager is on Goals and the Librarian is on Docs and Market. They stay out of the team chart and goal owner list.
- **Message bot**: a bot that works a human's email or a Slack channel, such as Inbox Manager. These appear separately under **Message bots** in the sidebar, Goals and setup.
- **External agent**: an agent outside the team connected to Tico (Codex, Claude, Grok), run by a human or a bot.
- **Owner**: the humans responsible for a bot, a goal or a computer.

## What a bot is made of

- **Instructions**: what a bot is told it does (`AGENT.md` in developer docs).
- **Tools**: everything a bot uses: its model and harness, GitHub, Slack, Google, AWS.
- **Model** and **Harness**: kinds of tool. The model (GPT-5.5, Opus) and the harness it runs in (Codex, Claude Code).
- **AI provider**: the account a model comes from.
- **Credential**: a stored secret a bot is granted. "API key" or "token" only names what a service gives you, or sign-in.
- **Template**: what you create a bot from.
- **Setup**: a new bot's first conversation with its owner. Status **Needs setup**, button **Set up**. **Finish setup** is installing Tico.

## Where bots run

- **Computer**: what you register and add (Settings > Computers).
- **Runner**: the software installed on a computer (install docs only).
- **Health**: what is wrong. Each problem is an **issue**.

## Work

- **Task**: work with a requester and an owner.
- **Routine**: a task that repeats on a schedule.
- **Needs you**: only when it needs the viewer. Otherwise **Needs <Name>**, as in "Needs Sam".
- **Approval**: a yes or no on one exact action.
- **Proposal**: a suggested change to a goal or KPI, for its owner to confirm.
- **Run**: one time a bot works.
- **Update**: a bot's daily or weekly post, and a new Tico version.
- **Message**, **Comment**, **Note**: a message is chat. A comment is on a task. A note is quiet, for a bot's next run ([leave work for the next run](using-tico.md#leave-work-for-the-next-run)).
- **Decision**: the typed-question model that classifies and decides.
- **Handoff**: delegating work by opening a child task and setting the parent to waiting.
- **Session**: the model conversation a bot is resuming. Disposable.
- **state.md**: a bot's own note of what it is doing and what to pick up next.
