# Listening

Listening saves posts a bot finds, asks the Decision provider to classify them, and routes useful posts to a receiving bot's
inbox. A receiving bot accepts, rejects or marks each post as a duplicate. A score alone does not contact anyone.

## Start with one topic

1. Open **Settings > Bots > Add from template**, choose Listening, and press **Set up** on its page.
   Tell it one topic to watch, the sources to read and what a useful result looks like. Connect any requested Tools and Credentials.
2. Ask your owner or computer operator to configure one destination in the server's `registry/listening.yaml`, as below.
   Choose a receiving bot that already exists, such as Content. Without destinations, posts can be saved and scored but route nowhere.
3. Configure a server Decision provider ([Decision setup](../questions/README.md)). Ask Listening for one sweep, then review the
   receiver's result before changing its Routine. Use `hub listening stats` to distinguish an empty sweep from a blocked source.

```yaml
destinations:
  content:
    category: content
    threshold: 0.75
    receiver: bot:content
    what: a question a useful article could answer
```

Categories are question ids in `questions/listening-item.json`. Optional `readers` can read a destination; only its receiving bot
or the Team owner can resolve it. An optional `unless: {category: vendor_pitch, threshold: 0.70}` excludes posts that clear
that second threshold. Changes affect future decisions; existing inbox rows remain.

To use your company's categories, put a validated question set in the server's
`registry/questions/listening-item.json` (`TICO_REGISTRY_DIR` selects the registry). It takes precedence over the shipped
copy. Both destination and `unless` categories must name `noul` questions; missing or differently typed categories appear
in Health and the server log. An invalid custom set is refused. Increase its `version` when changing questions: the
`id@version` label makes recent saved posts eligible for a new decision without duplicating existing inbox rows.

## Save, decide and resolve

These are internal v2 APIs and may change between releases. Only the Listening bot (`bot:listening`) and the Team owner can save
runs and make decisions. Receivers and configured readers can read their own destinations. Use a bot's run credential or the owner's
personal token; every POST has an `Idempotency-Key` for safe retries ([API](api.md)). The bodies below contain fictional data.

1. Save a sweep with `POST /api/v2/listening/runs` (`hub_listening_save`):

   ```json
   {"source":"news","query":"example app onboarding","status":"ok","pages_read":1,"items_seen":1,"items":[{"native_id":"example-1","url":"https://example.com/posts/1","content":"How can a small team write a helpful welcome guide?"}]}
   ```

   Keep `items[0].id` from the response as `<item-id>`. `status` is `ok`, `blocked`, `rate_limited` or `error`; a non-`ok`
   sweep needs a `note`. An `ok` sweep with no items means no results. A saved post is deduplicated by `(source, native_id)`;
   saving it again leaves its original content intact. Each sweep accepts at most 200 posts.
2. Ask for a decision with `POST /api/v2/listening/decide` (`hub_listening_decide`):

   ```json
   {"item_ids":["<item-id>"],"limit":1}
   ```

   `/api/v2/listening/judge` is the older compatible route. This sends saved post text to the configured Decision provider.
   Check `results` and `errors`; a successful HTTP response can contain per-post errors. Every destination whose category
   clears its threshold gets one intake row. If none clears, the post remains saved and goes nowhere.
3. As the receiver or owner, read `GET /api/v2/intake?destination=content&status=new` (`hub_listening_item_list`).
   Keep the intake row's `id` as `<intake-id>`; this differs from the saved post id. Resolve with
   `POST /api/v2/intake/<intake-id>/resolve` (`hub_listening_item_resolve`):

   ```json
   {"status":"rejected","reason":"The post has no detail our team can use."}
   ```

   `accepted` and `duplicate` require `receiver_ref`, the id of the record created or already present. `rejected` requires a
   reason. Repeating the same verdict is safe; changing a resolved verdict returns `409 conflict`. Receiving bots poll new rows;
   Tico does not push them.

Trace a post with `GET /api/v2/listening/items/<item-id>`, read sweep history with `GET /api/v2/listening/runs`, and inspect
coverage and receiver verdicts with `GET /api/v2/listening/stats`. Do not treat blocked or rate-limited sweeps as evidence that
no relevant posts exist. See `templates/environment-registry/listening.yaml` for the full routing shape.
