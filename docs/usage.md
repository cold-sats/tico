# Usage

Account menu > **Usage** shows what the bots' model runs cost, as an estimate: the tokens each run used, priced at the provider's public
list price. It is not an invoice.

## Where the numbers come from

The runner adds up the `tokens` events a run's runtime reports (`runner/usage.py`) and sends them with the run's result as
`usage`: uncached input, cached input and output tokens, the model that ran, and how the run was billed. The server keeps them on the run
(`turns.input_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `model`, `provider`, `est_cost_usd`, `billing`; migration 12) and prices them
from `providers.PRICES`, in USD per million tokens, dated by `providers.PRICES_AS_OF`. A cache write counts as input; batch, priority and
regional premiums are not modelled. A model with no price keeps its tokens and shows a dash for the cost. A runtime that reports no
tokens (Grok today) shows runs and no tokens.

A run on a ChatGPT or Claude sign-in (Codex "Signed in with ChatGPT", Claude with `claude.ai` or a long-lived OAuth token, a Cursor
account) is `billing: subscription`. It costs nothing extra, so its figure is shown as "API-equivalent" and kept out of the estimate of what
was spent.

## Who sees it

The owner and the admins see every bot. Anyone else sees the bots they own. A bot's own credentials cannot read it.

## Limits

A bot can have a daily and a monthly limit in estimated USD; the team has a default for bots with none of their own. Neither is set
until someone sets it. Change a bot's on its Usage row or in Settings > Bots; the owner and administrators also set the default (Usage >
Default limit). The owner of a bot may set its limit, no higher than the team default.

- At 80% of a limit the bot's owner (else the team owner) gets one message; a chip shows on the Usage row.
- At a limit the bot takes no new job until the period turns over or the limit is raised. The job stays queued, the bot reads "Paused: over
  its daily limit" on its page and in Tasks, and a run already going finishes.
- What counts is the estimate of the runs the bot has finished in the UTC day or month. Subscription runs count their API-equivalent only
  if the team turns on "Count subscription runs".
- A message is sent once per bot, period and limit, so raising a limit arms it again.

`GET /api/v2/usage/limits`, `PUT /api/v2/usage/limits` (the default) and `PUT /api/v2/usage/limits/{bot}` (empty follows the default).

## API

`GET /api/v2/usage?from=&to=&department=&group=bot|day|routine` (UTC dates, default the last 7 days, at most 366) returns `rows` and
`totals` with `runs`, `input_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `est_cost_usd` (null when every API-billed run used an unpriced
model), `subscription_equiv_usd`, and on each row its `share` of the total. `?bot=<slug>` returns that bot's `daily` series and top
`routines`. The legacy `department` query parameter filters by group; `group` selects how rows are aggregated. See `docs/openapi/v2.json`.

## Filter by the settings used for a run

Usage can group and filter by harness, model, effort and named subscription, and sort by estimated
cost, tokens, runs or name. Filters also apply to a bot's daily detail and CSV. Names refer to login
profiles, not people or subscription ownership. Assign a subscription in the bot's settings; changing
it affects future runs, not recorded usage.

Updated runners report the primary and fallback portions separately. A run that uses two models can
appear in both groups, while the overall run count counts it once. Token and cost totals include both
portions. API spend and subscription API-equivalent estimates stay separate, including when the
fallback uses a different billing method. Existing spend limits use the same portions.

Older runs retain their recorded totals. Unreported harness, effort or subscription values are shown
as **Not recorded / not applicable**, never filled from current bot settings. Automatic model choices
remain the runner's reported choice; this does not discover an underlying model selected by a provider.
A new runner talking to an older server falls back to the older final-portion usage report. Update the
server and runners to get complete primary/fallback attribution. No provider credentials are stored
with usage. This page is an estimate of Tico runs, not a provider invoice or a subscription quota meter.
