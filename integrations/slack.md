## What it is

The company's Slack workspace, reached through one app ("Tico") and one connector,
`connectors/slack.py`. The policy checks, the audit log and the retries live in the connector;
a direct API call skips all three and is a policy violation. Install and scopes:
[connectors/README.md](../connectors/README.md).

## What data it has

The channels the app has been invited to, listed under Tools > Slack channels
(`hub slack channel list`): for example a
marketing work log, sales, product release notes, support operations, a mention feed, an agents
channel, and the engineering alert channels an engineering bot watches (cloud, CI, error
tracking, deploys). DMs and
group DMs people send the bot. A DM to Tico, or an `@Tico` in a channel it is in, wakes the
employee the decision model routes it to and the reply comes back in that thread under the employee's name
([Tico in Slack: the gateway](../docs/slack-gateway.md)). A plain channel message wakes nobody
at once: it is stored, and the channel's `readers` in the registry get what they have not seen,
grouped by thread, on the gateway's hourly pass, the way an employee subscribed to the channel
catches up on it. A bot that is not a reader still reads a channel with `history` during a turn.

## How a bot uses it

```bash
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py doctor                                   # token, bot user, channels it is in
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py channels                                 # what the bot can see
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py history --as <slug> --channel '#release_notes' --since yesterday --threads --format md
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py history --as <slug> --channel '#marketing,#sales' --since 7d --tz America/Los_Angeles --format json
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py post --as <slug> --channel '#marketing' --text 'Shipped 3 doc updates.'
printf '%s\n' "$BODY" | $HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py post --as <slug> --channel '#agents' --text -
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py inbox --since 24h --format md --mark    # DMs people sent the bot; --mark advances the watermark
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py dm --as <slug> --to person@example.com --text 'Pricing doc is live.'
$HUB_DIR/connectors/slack.py reply --as <slug> --to person@example.com --thread 1756742400.000100 --text 'On it.'
```

Inside a hosted turn `HUB_BOT` stands in for `--as`. Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` failure
(token, network, Slack), `2` a hub policy refused it. `--json` gives errors as
`{"ok": false, "error", "hint"}`.

## Rules

- Reading needs `service: slack` with `read` in `tools:`; a `channels:` list on that entry
  limits `history` to those channels (plus any channel whose list entry names the bot as a reader) before any call
  reaches Slack; `dms: false` refuses `inbox`.
- Posting needs `post` in `can`, and the channel must be on the Slack channel list
  (Tools > Slack channels) with posting on, as it is unless an owner or admin turned it off. Externally shared (Slack Connect) channels are refused: posting there is an
  outbound send. Text over 4,000 characters is refused.
- A DM goes only to a person in `registry/hub-access.yaml`; bots and deactivated accounts are
  refused. Several recipients make one group DM.
- Internal posts and DMs are not outbound sends, so `outbound_send` does not gate them; the
  read-only period still applies to anything public.
- Every accepted post and DM is appended to `<projects>/runtime/slack-audit.jsonl`.
- Nothing from a mailbox goes into Slack. A refusal is an answer: put the draft on the task and,
  if the channel or verb really should change, file a task for `the owner`.
- A reply the gateway posts for you in a Slack thread is a solicited reply, shown under your
  name with `(sent from <you>)`. It needs no `post: true` and grants none: posting anything else
  there still goes through `post` and the registry.

## Recipes

- Yesterday in four channels, one section each, ready to read:
  `history --channel '#release-notes,#sales,#support,#engineering' --since yesterday --threads --format md`
- A fixed window, machine-readable: `history --channel <channel-id> --since 2026-09-01T09:00 --until 2026-09-01T17:00 --format json`
- An engineering bot's daily watch reads the alert channels with `--since 24h`; each channel's
  purpose is in the registry file.
- Use a channel id (`C...`) when a name is ambiguous; a channel that does not exist is refused,
  so check the registry file for the real name.

## Gotchas

- `search.messages` is rejected for this token type; read with `history` per channel instead.
- Private channels need a human to `/invite @Tico`; public ones the bot joins itself
  (`join --channel <id>`).
- `inbox` without `--mark` returns the same DMs next time; `--since` only floors a conversation
  with no watermark yet.
- The user directory is cached for a day in `runtime/slack-users.json`; a new hire may not
  resolve until it refreshes.
- A message that reached you from Slack carries `refs.slack` (channel, permalink, the last
  twelve exchanges) and `refs.routing` (why the decision model chose you). Answer in the conversation; the
  gateway posts it to that thread for you, under your name. Do not post to Slack yourself for
  that conversation: no `post`, no `dm`, no `reply`.

## Learnings

What bots and people learn about this integration is added with `hub tool learn slack "…"` and
shown under this page; a person folds it into the page over time. The page is the rule.
