# Documentation policy

## Current guidance versus notes

The Team Docs library describes how Acme operates today. Public product
documentation keeps its existing structure. Internal documentation covers current team
guidance, responsibilities and operating procedures, including customer support and platform
handling.

Research captures, audits, meeting records, proposals, implementation plans and historical
designs are not current team guidance. Preserve useful material in an organized Bot Notes
collection: Research, Plans and proposals, Historical records, Technical reference,
Marketing working files, Bot operating rules, and Library maintenance. Unclassified shared
files go to Needs review. These collections are excluded from the default documentation search.
When explicitly discussing a note, qualify it as reference rather than presenting it as policy.

`registry/company-docs.json` defines the reviewed Tico documents included in the current library
and explicit exceptions for notes. A file being under `docs/` does not by itself make it current
team guidance. The reader organizes existing source files without breaking bot references;
file deletion or physical relocation is unnecessary for removing clutter from the main library.

Promote useful research into a maintained procedure when the requested work and evidence support it. Preserve unresolved questions as questions; do not invent policy to
fill gaps. PRs remain proposed changes, separate from merged guidance.

Documentation has three homes. Keep one canonical copy and link to it rather than maintaining
parallel versions.

## Bot-internal documents

A bot may create, rewrite, reorganize, and commit documentation in its own repository with a
self-merged pull request or a direct commit, within the requested work and its Tools. This includes its
`knowledge/`, `reports/`, `memory/`, and `playbooks/`. The bot decides the useful structure and
level of standardization for its own work.

Bot autonomy does not waive privacy, security, evidence, access, or role boundaries. Never put
credentials, customer PII, private message text, or unsupported claims in git. A bot may not use
this rule to edit another bot's repository or change shared Team rules.

## Shared internal team documents

Team knowledge that more than one team needs belongs under Tico's `docs/`. Before adding a new
page, search for the canonical existing page and update it when practical.

An authorized employee may create a pull request containing only ordinary internal team
documentation under `docs/` and merge that pull request without the owner's review. The pull request
still provides history and a place for automated checks. This self-merge rule does not include
`policies/`, `registry/`, application or runner code, access controls, credentials, or public
product repositories; changes there must stay within the requested work and granted Tools.

Authenticated display of these documents on `hub.acme.example` remains internal distribution, not public
publishing. The same repository document should be rendered there rather than copied into a second
wiki.

## External and public documents

External documentation is customer-, partner-, candidate-, or public-facing content, including
documentation that ships from a product repository such as `acme/website`.

A bot may research, edit, validate, merge and deploy external documentation within the requested work and its Tools. Public content stays a draft until `outbound_send` is on. Verify the current head, docs-only scope and required checks, and use GitHub's matching-head merge guard without bypassing branch protection. Recheck a changed head. Do not make unrelated changes.

Before opening a pull request, list the target repository's open pull requests and look for an
existing compatible documentation-update pull request. If one exists, add the new documentation
commit to its branch and update its description instead of creating another pull request. Create a
new pull request only when no compatible one exists or the existing branch cannot safely be
updated; explain that exception in the new pull request.

Keep a reused pull request reviewable: list every changed page, summarize the new addition, and
keep unrelated product code out of it. The task handoff to the owner links the one open pull request
and says what changed; claim the documentation shipped only after verifying the merge and publication.

Opening or updating this review pull request is not itself public publishing. Requested public publication, deletion or live-copy changes follow the same Tools, evidence and outbound send rules.
