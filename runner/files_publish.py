"""Publish a bot's reports and artifacts as Tico files after a completed turn (docs/files.md).

The runner looks at the folders the bot writes deliverables to (`reports/` and `artifacts/` in its
checkout, or `files: {publish: [...]}` in employee.yaml), and uploads each new or changed file. What
it sends is decided here, on the bot's own computer: allowed types, a size cap, no credential-like
names, no symbolic links, nothing outside the checkout (clients/bot_files.py).

An upload is a row in a small outbox in the runner's own state database, keyed by the bot, the
path and the content digest. The same key is the request's idempotency key, so a retry after a
restart, or after a reply that never arrived, lands once. A file that could not be uploaded is
reported as "not synced" and never shown with a link that opens nothing.
