"""The server's word on what changed for this computer, in place of a dozen timed polls.

A runner used to ask about a dozen endpoints every few seconds (work, sign-ins, harness actions,
credential imports, its bots, their credentials, repositories, worktrees) whether anything was new,
and almost always heard no. Now it holds `GET /api/v2/runners/me/events` open (backend/events.py):
each `runner` event names a kind, and only the reads that kind covers run (CHANNELS). Everything
also runs once every BACKUP_POLL_S, so a missed event costs minutes, never work.

While the stream is down (it will not connect, it broke, the server refused it) the runner polls
exactly as it did before, until the stream is back; reconnects back off to RECONNECT_MAX_S and resume
from the last event id, so nothing said meanwhile is lost. A server without the endpoint (404) is
polled as before and asked again every LEGACY_RETRY_S.
