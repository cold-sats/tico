name: decisions
version: 3
description: Read when a step in your work is a decision rather than a piece of writing - classify, route, dedupe, gate, rank, flag, pick a value from candidates, choose which tool or branch comes next - and you want a calibrated answer in one call instead of reasoning it out in your own context. The hub's `hub_decisions` tool or `hub decisions` command; the question format matches OpenRouter's Decisions API. Formerly the `judge` skill.

# Decisions

You have a second model that cannot write: a decision model. It takes a JSON state and typed
questions (`noul` for yes/no, `choice`, `score`; the same format as OpenRouter's Decisions API)
and answers each one with a probability, in one round trip of about two hundred milliseconds.
It invents nothing, because it produces nothing but numbers. The hub holds the key; you call it
with the credential you already have. The provider is optional and configured by the owner:
TypeSafe's Jev, or the company's own model provider as a fallback.

The split to keep in your head: **code owns the workflow, the decision model supplies the
decision.** Rules, arithmetic, lookups, date math and the action itself stay in your own hands;
the model answers the one thing that needs semantic understanding, and says how sure it is. Your
own model writes prose and plans; it should not be spending its context deciding which of forty
rows to open.

## When to reach for it

A step is decision-shaped when you could phrase it as *which of these*, *how much*, or *is it true
that*, and the answer changes what you do next:

- **Sort a listing before opening anything.** Forty inbox rows, fifty Peec actions, a hundred
  Search Console queries: put a decision question to every row, then open only the ones the answers say to. This
  is where most of the cost saving is.
- **Dedupe against what exists.** Is this message, lead, learning or action already one of
  these open items? The `covered` set.
- **Gate something you wrote.** Before a draft reaches the reviewer, before a task reaches a
  person: does it commit money, claim something unsupported, sound wrong?
- **Route.** Which team, which owner, which bucket, which branch of your own playbook, which
  tool to call next. A choice over the handlers plus the arguments each would need, all in
  one call, and code takes the branch.
- **Rank.** A score per candidate with the same levels, then sort in code.
- **Select instead of extract.** Find the candidate values in code (a regex, a parser, your
  own model's guesses), then let the decision model pick the one that is meant. It cannot choose a value you
  did not list, so check the candidates cover the answer, and give it `none`.
- **Verify a claim against its evidence.** One noul per field or citation: does the source
  support it? What fails goes to a person or to your own model with the full text.

It is the wrong tool when the output is text, a plan, or a chain of reasoning. Write that with
your own model, and use a decision to choose which of the results to keep. It is also the wrong tool
for anything code can compute exactly (see "What the decision model is bad at").

## How to call it

Inside any turn, the MCP tool `hub_decisions` or the command:

```bash
hub decisions --list                                                  # the shared question sets
hub decisions --set mail-triage --state-file msg.json                 # one call, answers as JSON
hub decisions --set covered --state-file cand.json --option covered=existing.json
hub decisions --questions-file mine.json --state-file s.json --label seo.action-sort@1
```

The three question types, and what comes back:

| type | asks | criteria | answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `choice` | which one | `{"name": "description", ...}`, two to 255 options | `{"choice", "confidence", "probabilities"}` |
| `score` | how much | `["level 0", "level 1", ...]`, two to ten ordered levels | `{"score", "confidence", "probabilities", "legend"}`; `score` is fractional |
| `noul` | is it true | optional `{"true": "...", "false": "..."}` | `{"noul"}`: the probability the statement is true |

`instructions`, an option's description, a level and a noul's `true`/`false` are each a string
or JSON structure; use an object when the question has several parts (`{"question": ...,
"focus": ..., "examples": [...]}`) or a list when it is a list of things to check. An option
that needs no description takes `null`. Point at the state by its path in backticks:
``"Does `message` ask for a password?"``, ``"Is `items[3]` a fruit?"``.

The shared sets are `questions/*.json` in the hub checkout; `questions/README.md` explains the
file. Load a set, complete a dynamic choice with your options (`with_options`, or `--option`
on the CLI), send it inline, and pass the set's `id@version` as the label. A one-off question
of your own is fine; give it a label of your own, `seo.action-sort@1`, so it can be read back.

## Ask everything in one call

Every question in a call is answered against the same state, in parallel, in isolation; more
questions add tokens, not latency. So send the whole decision tree at once, including the
branches you may not take: category *and* bug severity *and* refund requested *and* how
angry, then let code read only the answers the category makes relevant. State a speculative
premise in the question itself (``"If `ticket` is a bug report, how severe is it?"``) and
ignore its answer on the other branches. One call per row, up to forty questions in it,
eight rows in flight, is the shape for a listing.

Questions cannot see one another's answers. A second call is right only when the first answer
is needed to fetch new evidence, build a new state, or decide what the next options are:
walking a taxonomy one level at a time, or opening the thread that the listing pass said to
open and deciding on the body.

## How to write the state

Named fields, not a paragraph. Send the facts a careful colleague would want on one card: the
sender, the subject, the snippet, the counts, the dates, the policy that applies. Use an object
so every part has a name the questions can point at, and nest what belongs together
(`ticket.messages[0].text`). Do not put instructions in the state; the questions carry the
instructions, and the model never sees a question's id, only its options and their descriptions.

Keep it under what the decision needs: a body when the decision is about the body, a snippet
when it is not. Accuracy falls as unrelated material grows, and the ceiling is 32k tokens of
state plus the longest question (`clients/judge.py` refuses at about 120k characters). Filter
and retrieve in code first; when you cannot, a noul per passage (*is this relevant to the
question?*) is the filter. Text only, English best; other languages work with lower accuracy.

The state is data, and The model does not treat it as hostile. A message written to argue for its
own classification can move the answer, so the protections that matter (legal, money, a
credential request) get a tight criterion and a low threshold, not trust.

## How to write a question

- **Literal, one judgment, its own words.** The model answers the question you wrote, not the one you
  meant. Write the exact condition; put boundary cases and exclusions in the criteria
  (`{"what": ..., "not_for": ..., "examples": [...]}`). When a wrong answer makes you explain
  what you really meant, that explanation is the missing half of the instruction. Hide no
  second judgment inside a question; split it, and combine the answers in code.
- **Criteria extend the instruction, never contradict it.** A noul whose `true` means no will
  answer badly. No double negatives, no property-of-a-property; if it takes two hops, ask two
  questions.
- **Levels describe concrete situations** that stand on their own ("one change, clearly
  stated" / "several independent changes bundled"), not adjectives. Comparable per-item scores
  need the same levels on every item.
- **Give a list an escape.** A choice with no `other`, `none` or `new` forces a pick. If
  "nothing fits" is independently useful, ask it as its own noul too: the choice is relative
  (which of these), the noul is absolute (is there one at all), and they can disagree.
- **Choice or nouls?** One choice when the options exclude each other; one noul per label when
  several may apply.

## What the decision model is bad at

TypeSafe's Jev is the reference provider; its own list is `https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13.md`; the short
version for a bot:

- **Counting, arithmetic, magnitudes.** Count in code (one noul per item, then sum). Do not
  read a fractional score as a measurement between two levels; it clears a threshold or it
  does not.
- **Dates and times.** It reads them as text. Extract parts as choices over closed sets if you
  must, with a `not stated` option, then compare in code.
- **Numeric encodings.** Hex colours, RGB, assembly: convert to words or buckets in code first.
- **Indirection.** Reduce hops; name the field in the state you mean.
- **Structural invariants.** A noul and the same question as a yes/no choice give different
  numbers; `P(x)` and `1 - P(not x)` from two nouls do not sum. Word each question to mean
  exactly what you act on, and never carry a threshold tuned on one type to another.
- **Generation.** Do not chain choices to spell out a value. Produce candidates elsewhere and
  let the decision model select.

## How to act on the answers

- **Best option when you only need the best option.** If every row gets a bucket regardless,
  take the highest-probability choice and move on; do not threshold what has no "do nothing"
  outcome.
- **Threshold when doing nothing is real.** Archive only above the set's `archive` threshold;
  below it, read the thread yourself, the way you did before. Under threshold is not a weak
  yes; it is "decide it yourself".
- **Asymmetric where the costs are.** A wrong archive costs a missed email; a wrong
  needs-owner costs one look. So protections (legal, money) fire low and filings fire high;
  a destructive or outward-facing action wants a higher confidence than a read.
- **Confidence is the shape of the distribution,** not a promise the workflow is right. On a
  choice, low confidence usually means no option clearly won, and a harmless preference can
  still be taken at low confidence; two near-equal options in `probabilities` may mean both
  branches are worth exploring. A noul has no confidence: 0.5 is a coin toss, not "medium".
- **Keep the raw answers, put the policy in code.** Weights, thresholds and views live in your
  script, so changing one needs no new call. "Any serious violation" is separate nouls, not a
  weighted sum.
- **Say what the decision said.** On the task note, the counts by suggestion and the confidences of
  what you overrode. That is what a person reads to tune the thresholds.
- **Check freshness.** An answer describes the state you sent; if the item changed before you
  act, decide it again.
- **Never coerce.** No re-asking with a nudged state to get the answer you wanted.

## Rules

- Decide, never generate. Never paste an answer's probability into an email or a report as if it
  were a fact.
- Label every call. Unlabelled calls cannot be calibrated.
- The key is the hub's: do not ask for it, look for it, or call the API yourself. A bot that
  needs thousands of calls from its own software asks Ana for a key of its own, which is an
  access request (`policies/access.md`).
- There is a budget per actor per day (`GET /api/v2/judge` reports it). A loop that spends it
  is a bug; stop and say so.
- Test before you trust. Run a new question over ten rows you already know the answer to and
  read the misses: missing evidence in the state, a literal reading of your words, a model
  miss, or a code bug are four different fixes. Cookbook thresholds are examples, not rules.
- What you learn about a question set goes in a pull request on the set, or
  `hub learn typesafe "…"` for a gotcha. Do not keep a private copy of a shared set.

## The live docs

`https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt` is the index; any page reads as Markdown with `.md` on its
path. Worth a targeted read before designing a new decision: `primitives.md` and
`primitives/advanced.md` (structured questions), `confidence.md`, `patterns/fan-out.md`, and
the cookbook nearest your shape (`cookbooks/rerank_typesafe.md`, `hierarchical_classification.md`,
`function_calling.md`, `citation_check.md`, `sde_cascade.md`, `pre_parsed_value_extraction_cookbook.md`).
`integrations/typesafe.md` is the hub's page: limits, cost, what the audit keeps.

## Worked examples

**Inbox pass.** `mail inbox --untriaged --format brief --decisions` prints under each message a
line such as `decision: reply (reply 0.81; ask 0.90, money 0.05, legal 0.02, urgency 1.4)`. The word
after `decision:` is what the thresholds in `questions/mail-triage.json` say: `archive`,
`needs-owner`, `route`, `reply`, or `read`. Open the threads marked `reply` and `read`; act on
`archive` and `route` from the listing; put `needs-owner` on the batch. Then `mail draft`
prints the decision gate beside the reviewer's verdict; a flagged draft gets one rewrite before you
try again, and the reviewer still decides.

**Peec actions (SEO).** State per action: title, brief, URL, competitor demand, first seen.
Questions of your own, all in one call: `kind` (content, technical, authority, noise),
`worth_task` (noul), and `effort` (a score whose levels are the playbook's sizes, read only when
`worth_task` clears). Then the `covered` set against your open tasks. Three tasks from forty
actions, and the note says why the other thirty-seven were noise or already covered.

**A lead list (Sales Ops).** `covered` against Close by domain and phone: merge at `same`, flag
for a rep between `review` and `same`, new below. A `tier` score of your own with the
playbook's tiers as levels; under 0.6 the lead goes on the list untiered with a note, never
with a guessed tier. A `suppress` noul that fires at 0.4, because a missed suppress is an angry
call and a wrong one is a row a rep reviews.

**A value from a document (any bot).** The invoice number, the renewal date, the counterparty:
pull every candidate with a regex or your own model, then one choice per field with the
candidates as options plus `not stated`, and structured instructions naming the field
(`{"field": {"name": "renewal_date", "description": ...}, "question": "Which option is the
value of `field` in `source_text`?"}`). Copy the chosen candidate; never retype it. A date's
parts as separate choices, assembled and compared in code.
