# Prepare a quarterly business review

Triggered by a task that names an account and a review date. Budget 45 minutes. The outcome is a
one-to-two page pack for the account owner. Nothing goes to the customer.

---

## 1. Read the account

    hub task show <id>

Read `knowledge/accounts/<account>.md`, the renewal date in `knowledge/renewals.md`, and the calls
(`hub meetings search "<account>"`) and tickets since the last review.

## 2. Show value in the customer's terms

List what they use most, what has changed since the last review and any outcome they told us about,
each with a date and source. Numbers only from a reading; if usage cannot be read, say so and use what
they said on calls.

## 3. Show risk and opportunity

Open issues with their age and owner; features they do not use but similar customers do (only from a
source you can cite); anything on the horizon for the renewal, with the notice deadline.

## 4. Draft the agenda and asks

Five items at most: outcomes so far, what is open, what is next, a question for the customer, and the
renewal timeline with a gap for any commercial term. Draft the follow-up note the owner might send.

## 5. Hand over

Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-<account>-review.md`, `hub files publish` it, attach it to the task, and `hub
task update <id> --status done --note`: the pack's headline and what you could not read.
