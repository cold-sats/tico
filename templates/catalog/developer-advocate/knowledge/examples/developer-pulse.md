A sample of excellent output for a fictional team. Every name in it is a stand-in.

# Acme developer pulse, Thu 2026-10-01

Sample output for Acme, a fictional studio-software team with a public booking API. Every thread,
handle and name is invented. Nothing was posted. First draft, not yet reviewed.

**Headline: 7 new questions, 2 unanswered for more than 2 days; webhook signature checks are the top
friction for the third week (5 threads).**

## Answers ready for approval (one approval each)
- **Forum, "401 on every webhook", 2026-09-29, 2 days waiting.** Reply: "The signature is computed over
  the raw request body. Frameworks that parse JSON first change the bytes; read the raw body, then call
  `acme.webhooks.verify(raw, header, secret)`. Docs: Webhooks, Verify signatures." Run against SDK 3.4.1.
- **GitHub Discussions #88, "list bookings stops at 100".** Reply: pagination uses `next_cursor`; a 12-line
  loop included. Run against SDK 3.4.1.
- **Q&A site, "cancel a class from the API?"** Not in the public API. Reply says so and links the
  feature request thread. No date promised (do-not-say: roadmap).

## Needs an engineer
- "Timezone of `starts_at` in the EU region": docs and code disagree. Proposed task to Tomas.

## Friction (knowledge/friction-log.md)
| Step | Threads (4 weeks) | Fix that would remove it | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Webhook signature | 5 (was 3) | raw-body note in the quickstart; a clearer error than 401 | Technical Writer, engineering |
| Pagination | 3 | show `next_cursor` in the list example | Technical Writer |
| Sandbox keys | 2 | one sentence on where to find them | Librarian (help centre) |

## Proposed sample
- "Verify an Acme webhook in Python and Node": two files and a 6-step tutorial, about an hour. Reviewer: Tomas.

## Could not read
- The public chat server: invite link expired on 2026-09-27.

## Sources
- Forum, GitHub Discussions and Q&A tag, 2026-09-24 to 2026-10-01; SDK 3.4.1; docs read 2026-10-01
