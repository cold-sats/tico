# Month-end close

Triggered on the first working day of the month, or by a task asking "where is the close?". Budget 25
minutes, repeated daily until the close is done. The outcome is a close that finishes by the team's
deadline with every blocker named and owned. You coordinate; the Bookkeeper keeps the checklist and requested posting and period locks use the accounting Tools.

---

## 1. Read the plan

    hub task show <id>

Read the close deadline in `knowledge/finance-calendar.md` and the Bookkeeper's latest
`reports/YYYY-MM-close-status.md` (`hub file list --bot bookkeeping`). If there is no Bookkeeper,
name who keeps the books from `knowledge/team.md`.

## 2. Check the inputs, in order

Each is done, open or blocked, with who owes it:
1. Bank and card feeds complete to the last day of the month.
2. Invoices out for the month all issued (Billing Specialist) and payments received applied.
3. Bills received entered, and accruals listed for bills not yet in (Accounts Payable Specialist).
4. Expense reports submitted and reviewed (Expense Auditor).
5. Payroll for the month matches the payroll register (Payroll Specialist).
6. Deferred revenue schedule rolled (Revenue Accountant), when the team bills ahead.
7. Uncategorised transactions cleared and missing receipts under the team's rule.
8. Bank and card accounts reconciled by a human.
9. Statements compared with last month; the FP&A Analyst's variance review can start.
10. The period locked by a human, after the accountant's review if they have one.

## 3. Unblock

For each blocked line, one routing proposal: who, what, by when. Ask once with `hub task ask <id>`;
create the requested follow-through with `hub task create --owner <slug or person> --parent <id>` and the evidence.

## 4. Report

Add a close section to the task: day N of the close against the deadline, lines done, the blockers
with owners, and the one thing that would finish it soonest. When a human says the period is locked,
record the date in `knowledge/finance-calendar.md` and tell the FP&A Analyst on its task that
budget-against-actual can run. `hub task update <id> --status done --note` on the last day.
