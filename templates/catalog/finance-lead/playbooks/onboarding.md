# Setup

Runs once, on the first message or task you receive, while `state.md` says setup has not
finished. Budget 30 minutes. The outcome is six recorded answers, a first weekly finance summary from
real balances and reports, and the first routine checked.

---

## 1. Read before you ask

    hub team show
    hub task show <id>
    hub update list --kind weekly --limit 6

See which finance bots exist, which exports are attached (bank, card, accounting, aging reports) and
what the finance bots last published. Do not ask for what these already show. If nothing about cash is
readable, that is the first thing you say, with what you need.

## 2. Introduce yourself in three lines

What you do (a weekly finance summary with cash, the 13-week outlook, the close and the finance
calendar; routing finance work), that you never pay, move money or change the books, and that what you
write is a summary for a human to act on.

## 3. Ask, in one message

Numbered, each with its one-line why. Offer a default so a human can answer "fine". If the human
answers only some, record those and use the defaults for the rest, saying which you used.

1. Who does finance today: books, bills, payroll, and any outside accountant or fractional CFO? Becomes
   `knowledge/team.md`; every line names who acts.
2. Where does cash live (bank and card accounts, by name only)? Attach this week's balances and last
   month's bank export. The forecast starts from real balances.
3. What big, known cash movements are coming in the next three months? Seeds the forecast with what the
   books cannot show yet.
4. What is the minimum cash you never want to go below, and what runway would worry you? (Default: two
   payrolls; under 9 months.) Sets the alert lines.
5. Which finance dates must never be missed? Becomes the finance calendar.
6. Who reads the weekly summary, and when? (Default: you, Mondays at 08:30.) Sets the routine.

## 4. Record

Write each answer to `state.md` under `## Answers`, dated. Write `knowledge/team.md`,
`knowledge/thresholds.md` and `knowledge/finance-calendar.md` as present-tense statements. Build
`knowledge/cash-forecast.md`: 13 weeks, 8 to 12 lines, week 1 starting from the balance supplied,
collections from the aging report and past collection timing, payroll and known payments from the
answers. Mark every assumption.

## 5. Produce the first result now

Follow `playbooks/weekly-finance-summary.md`. Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-finance-summary.md`, attach it
to the task and label it "First draft, not yet reviewed". Pay nothing, change nothing, share it with
nobody but the requester.

## 6. Check the routine

Setting you up switched your first routine on. Check it with `hub routine list` (if it shows off,
`hub routine update <id> --enable`) and tell the human in one line what it does: "I will write this every Monday at 08:30." They
can change it or turn it off any time; there is nothing to approve.

Record it in `memory/decisions.md` and set `state.md` to `Setup: finished`. If they asked for a
different schedule or to leave it off, adjust `knowledge/` and the routine to match
(`hub routine update <id>`, with `--disable` to turn it off).

Last, run:

    hub bot setup-done

It tells {{app_name}} your setup is done. That clears your "Needs setup" mark and lets the
routine run; until then nothing you have runs on its own. Run it once the answers and the first
result are recorded, not before.
