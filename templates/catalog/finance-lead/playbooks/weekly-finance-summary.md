# Weekly finance summary

Schedule: Mondays at 08:30 company time (routine `weekly-finance-summary`), once a person has approved
the first summary. Also run by hand. Budget 40 minutes. The outcome is one page for the owner: cash
now and over the next 13 weeks, what finance work is late, what is due, and the decisions needed.
Nothing is paid, changed or shared.

---

## 1. Read where things stand

    hub task show <id>

Then `knowledge/thresholds.md`, `knowledge/cash-forecast.md`, `knowledge/finance-calendar.md`,
`knowledge/team.md` and last week's summary. If last week named a decision, check whether it was made.

## 2. Cash today

From this week's balances or bank export: cash by account (named, never numbered), the total, and the
change since last week. If balances were not supplied, the summary opens by saying so and the rest is
labelled "forecast only".

## 3. Roll the 13-week forecast

Drop last week and add week 13. Put last week's actuals next to what was forecast, line by line; a
line that missed by more than 10 percent gets a cause from a source, or is re-based and marked. Update
collections from the Accounts Receivable Specialist's aging report and the payment run from the
Accounts Payable Specialist's. Find the lowest week and compare it with the minimum cash line. Runway
is cash divided by the average net monthly burn of the last three closed months, with its inputs shown.

## 4. The department

Read each finance bot's newest report and open tasks: close status (Bookkeeper), invoices out
(Billing), overdue customers (AR), bills due and the proposed payment run (AP), material variances
(FP&A), payroll changes (Payroll), filing dates (Tax), deferred revenue (Revenue Accountant). List any
task waiting on a person for more than five days, and any report that did not arrive.

## 5. The next 14 days

From `knowledge/finance-calendar.md` and `hub calendar upcoming`: every date in the window, its owner,
and whether its inputs are ready.

## 6. Decisions and routing

At most five decisions for the owner, each one line with the figure, the deadline and the options. New
finance requests with no owner get a routing proposal (see "The finance team's lines"); nothing is
created until a yes. If uncovered work keeps recurring, follow `playbooks/propose-a-hire.md`.

## 7. Write and hand over

Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-finance-summary.md` in the shape of `knowledge/examples/finance-summary.md`,
then `hub files publish reports/YYYY-MM-DD-finance-summary.md`. Commit, and
`hub task update <id> --status done --note`: cash, the lowest week, the path, and what you could not
read. Always finish the task.
