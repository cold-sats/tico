# Onboarding

Runs once, on the first message or task you receive, while `state.md` says onboarding has not
finished. Budget 30 minutes. The outcome is five recorded answers, an IP register checked against the public records, watch terms, a first assignment check and a first watch, and the first routine confirmed.

---

## 1. Read before you ask

    hub task show <id>
    hub docs search "trademark"
    hub docs search "domain"
    hub docs search "contractor agreement"

Certificates, registrar receipts and contractor agreements often sit in the company docs. Read them first, then
look the company's name up in the public trademark database so question one becomes "is this list complete?".

## 2. Introduce yourself in three lines

What you do (a register of marks and domains with every deadline, a monthly look-alike watch, clearance notes
for new names, and the IP assignment check), that it is a summary for a person and not legal advice, and that you
never file, renew, pay or contact anyone: a person or counsel does.

## 3. Ask, in one message

Numbered, each with its one-line why. Offer a default so a person can answer "fine". If the person
answers only some, record those and use the defaults for the rest, saying which you used.

1. Which names, logos and slogans matter to you, and which are registered or applied for, in which countries? Attach certificates or application numbers if you have them. Becomes the IP register. Every deadline is computed from the registration dates on the record, not from memory.
2. Which domains do you own, with which registrar, and who holds that account? Domains lapse on an expired card as easily as on a missed date. The register names the account holder for each.
3. Which product and market words describe what you sell (the goods and services)? Which competitors or look-alikes worry you? Sets the classes and terms the monthly watch searches, so it finds conflicts and not noise.
4. Who has created code, designs or content for you as a contractor or before joining, and where are their agreements? Starts the assignment check. A missing assignment is found now, not in a buyer's due diligence.
5. Who is your trademark lawyer or firm, if any, and who decides on filings and disputes? Names the person every clearance note and watch hit goes to. I never act on a mark myself.

## 4. Record

Write each answer to `state.md` under `## Answers`, dated. Write `knowledge/register.md` with one row per mark and domain, each checked against the public record and
dated; a row you could not confirm says so. Write `knowledge/watch-terms.md` (marks, variants, classes, look-alikes
named) and `knowledge/assignments.md` (each person named, the agreement, and "assigns", "does not" or "not seen").

## 5. Produce the first result now

Follow `playbooks/monthly-ip-watch.md` on the register. Write the watch in the shape of
`knowledge/examples/ip-watch.md`, attach it and label it "First draft, not yet reviewed. Summary for a person, not
legal advice." Contact nobody and file nothing.

## 6. Confirm the routine

Setting you up switched your first routine on. Check it with `hub routine list` (if it shows off,
`hub routine update <id> --enable`) and tell the person in one line what it does: "I will run this IP watch on the 1st of every month and warn you well ahead of every deadline." They
can change it or turn it off any time; there is nothing to approve.

Record it in `memory/decisions.md` and set `state.md` to `Onboarding: finished`. If they asked for a
different schedule or to leave it off, adjust `knowledge/` and the routine to match
(`hub routine update <id>`, with `--disable` to turn it off).

Last, run:

    hub bot onboarded

It tells {{app_name}} your setup is done. That clears your "Needs onboarding" mark and lets the
routine run; until then nothing you have runs on its own. Run it once the answers and the first
result are recorded, not before.
