# Write a test plan

Triggered by a task naming a release, a milestone or a large pull request ("test plan for 2.15", "what should
we test before the billing change ships"). Budget 40 minutes. The outcome is one test plan and a regression
checklist a person can run in an afternoon. Nothing is run against production and nothing changes on GitHub.

## 1. Read what is changing

    hub task show <id>
    gh pr list -R <repo> --state merged --search "merged:>YYYY-MM-DD" --json number,title,files,labels
    gh pr view <n> -R <repo>

List each change in one line: what it does for a user, the files or area it touches, whether it has tests
of its own (look for changed test files) and whether it touches a risky area in `knowledge/areas.md`
(payments, auth, data export, migrations, anything with a past incident in `knowledge/themes.md`).

## 2. Rank by risk

Risk is likelihood of breaking times impact if it does. Put first: changes to money, sign-in, data loss or
migration paths; changes with no test files; areas with open bugs or a recent incident; changes that touch
more than one area. Say why each is ranked where it is, in one clause.

## 3. Write the cases

For the top risks, cases a person can follow without asking: preconditions, steps, the expected result, and
the negative case (wrong input, expired session, a second click). Keep automated checks to what CI already
runs; name gaps where a unit or integration test would catch the same thing earlier, as a suggestion for the
author. Aim for 10 to 25 cases, not 100.

## 4. The regression checklist

The short list of paths that must still work whatever changed: from `knowledge/regression.md` (start it from
the product's core flows if it does not exist), plus any flow a recent bug broke. One line each.

## 5. Hand over

Write `reports/test-plans/<release>.md`: headline (the three riskiest changes), the ranked table (change,
risk, why, cases), the cases, the checklist, and what you could not read. `hub files publish` it, attach it
to the task, commit, then `hub task update <id> --status done --note`. A person runs the plan and records
the results; a failed case becomes a proposed issue in your next triage pass.
