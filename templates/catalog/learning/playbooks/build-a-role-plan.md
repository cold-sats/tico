# Build a role learning plan

Triggered by a task naming a role and level, or a person's manager asking for a plan. Budget 40
minutes. The outcome is a one-page plan the manager can hand over, mostly built from work and
colleagues, with at most two courses. Requested spending follows the stated budget and your Tools.

---

## 1. Read what the level asks for

    hub task show <id>
    hub doc ask "What does the level guide say for <role> at <level>?"

List the four to six skills that separate this level from the one below. If there is no level guide,
ask the manager for the three things a person at this level does that one below does not.

## 2. Work that builds each skill

For each skill, one piece of real work in the next quarter that stretches it (own a small project, run a
customer review, lead an incident review), named by type, not assigned to anyone.

## 3. People to learn from

For each skill, the role (not a name unless the manager gives one) who does it well, and what to do with
them: shadow a call, review each other's work, a monthly conversation.

## 4. Courses, only where they earn it

At most two, each tied to a skill that work alone will not teach (a certification, a technical
foundation). Provider, length, cost, a finish-by date. Read the course page (`hub doc fetch <url>`) and
note what it actually covers.

## 5. How to know it worked

One observable sign per skill that the manager can check at the next review.

## 6. Hand over

Write `knowledge/plans/<role>.md` if it is a role plan (no personal detail), attach it to the task, and
record any course cost and make requested purchases within the budget and your Tools.
