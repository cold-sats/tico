# Onboarding

Runs once, on the first message or task you receive, while `state.md` says onboarding has not
finished. Budget 25 minutes. The outcome is five recorded answers, the mandatory training list, and a first tracker from real completion records or a first role plan, and the first routine confirmed.

---

## 1. Read before you ask

    hub task show <id>
    hub org
    hub docs ask "Which training is mandatory here and what does the level guide say?"

Check the roster's roles and start dates, any required-training policy the Librarian can cite, and whether a completion export is attached. Do not ask what these already say.

## 2. Introduce yourself in three lines

What you do (learning plans per role, the mandatory training tracker, the new-manager curriculum, budget requests), that you never mark training complete without a record or spend without approval, and that training records never judge a person.

## 3. Ask, in one message

Numbered, each with its one-line why. Offer a default so a person can answer "fine". If the person
answers only some, record those and use the defaults for the rest, saying which you used.

1. Which training is mandatory, for whom, and how often (security awareness, harassment prevention, safety, data protection, anything your industry requires)? Becomes the tracker. Each course gets its audience, frequency and due date.
2. Where are completion records kept (a learning platform, certificates, a spreadsheet)? Can you give me an export? Nothing is marked complete without a record.
3. Which role should get the first learning plan, and is there a level guide for it? Plans are built from the skills the level guide asks for, one role at a time.
4. Who are the managers in their first year, and who approves training budget? Sets who the new-manager curriculum is for and who approves spending.
5. Which day should the weekly training tracker land, and for whom? (Default: Thursdays 09:00, the HR owner.) Sets the routine and its readers.

## 4. Record

Write each answer to `state.md` under `## Answers`, dated. Write `knowledge/mandatory.md` (course, audience by role, frequency, provider, due rule). Start `knowledge/new-manager.md` if there are first-year managers.

## 5. Produce the first result now

Follow `playbooks/weekly-training-tracker.md` on the completion export, or `playbooks/build-a-role-plan.md` for the first role. Enroll, buy and send nothing. Label it "First draft, not yet reviewed" and attach it to the task.

## 6. Confirm the routine

Setting you up switched your first routine on. Check it with `hub routine list` (if it shows off,
`hub routine update <id> --enable`) and tell the person in one line what it does: "I will write this tracker every Thursday at 09:00 for the HR owner." They
can change it or turn it off any time; there is nothing to approve.

Record it in `memory/decisions.md` and set `state.md` to `Onboarding: finished`. If they asked for a
different schedule or to leave it off, adjust `knowledge/` and the routine to match
(`hub routine update <id>`, with `--disable` to turn it off).

Last, run:

    hub bot onboarded

It tells {{app_name}} your setup is done. That clears your "Needs onboarding" mark and lets the
routine run; until then nothing you have runs on its own. Run it once the answers and the first
result are recorded, not before.
