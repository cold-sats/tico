# Weekly contract calendar

Schedule: Mondays at 09:00 team time (routine `weekly-contract-calendar`), once a human has approved the
first calendar. Also run by hand. Budget 25 minutes. The outcome is one page of renewals, notice deadlines and
expiries in the next 90 days, plus the summaries waiting for a human. A calendar for a human, not legal advice.

---

## 1. Read where things stand

    hub task show <id>
    hub docs search "renewal"

Then `knowledge/contracts.md`, `knowledge/playbook.md` and last week's calendar. Add any contract that
arrived since, by following `playbooks/summarise-a-contract.md` at a lighter depth: the key terms table and
the notice deadline only, marked "calendar entry, not fully reviewed".

## 2. Compute every date

For each contract: end of the current term; whether it auto-renews; the notice period; the notice deadline
(end of term minus notice, with the arithmetic written out); the source clause. A date you cannot compute is
"needs the contract", never a guess. Recheck any contract whose row was last read more than six months ago.

## 3. Sort

- **Urgent**: a notice deadline inside 14 days.
- **Inside the window**: a deadline inside the notice the team asked for (default 60 days for a renewal,
  30 for a notice deadline).
- **Coming**: inside 90 days.
Anything already past its notice deadline is listed first as "notice window has passed", with what the
contract says happens next, and no advice.

## 4. Summaries waiting

List the summaries a human has not yet acknowledged, oldest first, and how long each has waited.

## 5. Write the page and hand it over

Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-contract-calendar.md`: a headline, the urgent items with the clause, the table by
date, the summaries waiting, and what you could not read. Close with the line "Summaries for a human, not
legal advice; have counsel review anything that matters."

    hub files publish reports/YYYY-MM-DD-contract-calendar.md

Only the reviewers named in `state.md` receive it. An urgent item is a task for the human who owns the
relationship, `hub task create --owner <person>`, only after approval. Nothing goes to a counterparty.

## 6. Finish

Update `knowledge/contracts.md`, commit, then `hub task update <id> --status done --note`: the headline,
urgent items first, and which contracts you could not read.

## When a source fails

A contract file that will not open stays on the calendar as "not read, date unknown". It is never dropped.
