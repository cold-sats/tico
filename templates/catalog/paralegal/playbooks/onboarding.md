# Setup

Runs once, on the first message or task you receive, while `state.md` says onboarding has not
finished. Budget 25 minutes. The outcome is five recorded answers, the team's standard and acceptable variations written down, a real NDA checked and the index started, and the first routine confirmed.

---

## 1. Read before you ask

    hub task show <id>
    hub docs search "NDA"
    hub docs search "non-disclosure"

Look for the team's NDA template and signed NDAs in the team docs, and NDAs attached to open tasks. If the
template is already in the docs, question one becomes "is this the current one?".

## 2. Introduce yourself in three lines

What you do (check every inbound NDA against the team standard, prepare outbound ones, ready the signature
packets and keep the signed index), that it is a summary for a human and not legal advice, and that you never
sign or send: a human does.

## 3. Ask, in one message

Numbered, each with its one-line why. Offer a default so a human can answer "fine". If the human
answers only some, record those and use the defaults for the rest, saying which you used.

1. Attach your standard NDA (mutual and one-way if you have both). If you have none, which one do you usually sign? Becomes knowledge/standard-nda.md, the text every inbound NDA is compared with, clause by clause.
2. Which variations may a human accept without a lawyer: confidentiality period, governing law, a residuals clause, non-solicit? (Default: 2 to 5 years, your home law or the other side's, no residuals, no non-solicit.) Becomes knowledge/variations.md. Inside it an NDA is marked ready for a human; outside it goes to counsel.
3. Who signs NDAs and other standard agreements for the team, and in what order? Every signature packet names the signer. I never sign or send it.
4. Which other standard agreements do you use on your own paper (order form, contractor agreement, referral agreement)? Sets which templates I fill for outbound requests; anything else goes to the Contracts Manager.
5. Where do signed agreements live today, and which older ones should I index first? The executed-agreement index starts from the real files, so the next 'where is the signed copy?' has an answer.

## 4. Record

Write each answer to `state.md` under `## Answers`, dated. Write `knowledge/standard-nda.md` from the template, one heading per clause. Write `knowledge/variations.md`
in the human's words, with the defaults you used marked as defaults. Write `knowledge/templates.md` and start
`knowledge/executed-index.md` with the signed agreements you were pointed to.

## 5. Produce the first result now

Follow `playbooks/nda-desk.md` for the NDA waiting on a task, or, if none is waiting, check the last NDA the
team signed against its own standard. Write it in the shape of `knowledge/examples/nda-check.md`, attach it and
label it "First draft, not yet reviewed. Summary for a human, not legal advice." Nothing is sent.

## 6. Confirm the routine

Setting you up switched your first routine on. Check it with `hub routine list` (if it shows off,
`hub routine update <id> --enable`) and tell the human in one line what it does: "I will run the NDA desk every weekday at 09:00, and a human sends and signs everything." They
can change it or turn it off any time; there is nothing to approve.

Record it in `memory/decisions.md` and set `state.md` to `Setup: finished`. If they asked for a
different schedule or to leave it off, adjust `knowledge/` and the routine to match
(`hub routine update <id>`, with `--disable` to turn it off).

Last, run:

    hub bot onboarded

It tells {{app_name}} your setup is done. That clears your "Needs setup" mark and lets the
routine run; until then nothing you have runs on its own. Run it once the answers and the first
result are recorded, not before.
