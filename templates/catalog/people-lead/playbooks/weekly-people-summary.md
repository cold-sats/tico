# Weekly people summary

Schedule: Mondays at 08:30 team time (routine `weekly-people-summary`), after setup. Also run by hand. Budget 35 minutes. The outcome is one confidential page for the named
readers: hires against plan, who starts and leaves, what is due, and who should take what. Nothing is
assigned, published or sent.

---

## 1. Read where things stand

    hub task show <id>
    hub team show
    hub calendar list

Then `knowledge/headcount-plan.md`, `knowledge/people-calendar.md`, `knowledge/routing.md` and last
week's summary. If last week named an action, check whether it happened and say so.

## 2. Hires against plan

For each planned role: target start date, status (not opened, open, interviewing, offer, filled), and
days past target. Read the status from `recruiting`'s latest pipeline report or the hiring tasks; a role
with no source is "status unknown", never "on track". Headline number: filled against planned this quarter.

## 3. Starters and leavers

Starters in the next 30 days (from `people-hr`'s tracker) and leavers with a last day in the next 30
(from `people-ops`). First name or reference, role, date. Flag any leaver with no offboarding checklist.

## 4. Deadlines

Every item in `knowledge/people-calendar.md` falling in the next 30 days, with owner and status. Anything
due in 7 days and not done is bold and goes into "Needs a human".

## 5. What the people bots produced

For each people bot in `hub team show`: its newest report and anything waiting on a human more than 5 days.
One line each. A bot you could not read is named.

## 6. Routing and hiring proposals

Each unowned people request gets one routing line (owner, reason) from `knowledge/routing.md`. If the
same unowned work appeared three or more times this month, add one hiring proposal following
`playbooks/propose-a-new-bot.md`. Create nothing.

## 7. Write and hand over

Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-people-summary.md` in the shape of `knowledge/examples/people-summary.md`, then
`hub file publish reports/YYYY-MM-DD-people-summary.md --scope task --task <id>`. Commit, and
`hub task update <id> --status done --note`: the headline, the path, what you could not read.

## When a source fails

Name it and what is therefore unknown, and keep going. A count built from tasks alone says so.
