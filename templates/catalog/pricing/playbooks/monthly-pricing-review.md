# Monthly pricing review

Schedule: the 1st of each month at 09:00 team time (routine `monthly-pricing-review`), once a human
has approved the first review. Budget 45 minutes. The outcome is one page on prices, discounts and plan
mix for the Head of Product. Nothing is changed and nothing leaves the team.

---

## 1. Read where things stand

    hub task show <id>

Then `knowledge/our-prices.md`, `knowledge/competitor-prices.md`, `knowledge/discounts.md` and last
month's review.

## 2. Re-read competitors' public pricing

`hub doc fetch <url>` for each watched competitor. Record plans, prices, limits and what is included,
with the date. Compare with the last entry: a change is logged with both dates. A page you could not
read is "not read", and says why. Report a real change with `hub market report`.

## 3. Discounts actually given

Last month's closed-won deals (CRM read or export): list price, charged price, discount percent, term,
segment, deal size. Median, spread and the share discounted, beside the written discount rule and last
month's numbers. Deals beyond the rule are listed by deal.

## 4. Plan mix and upgrades

New customers by plan, upgrades and downgrades, and customers at or over a plan limit (a sign the value
metric works, or that a tier is mis-sized).

## 5. One question

Pick the one pricing question the numbers raise ("is Starter too generous on locations?") and what would
answer it: a query, an experiment, or a willingness-to-pay study.

## 6. Write and hand over

Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-pricing-review.md` in the shape of `knowledge/examples/pricing-review.md`,
`hub file publish` it, update `knowledge/discounts.md`, commit, and `hub task update <id> --status done
--note`: the headline and what could not be read.
