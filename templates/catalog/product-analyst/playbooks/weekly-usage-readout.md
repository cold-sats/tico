# Weekly product usage readout

Schedule: Wednesdays at 09:00 team time (routine `weekly-usage-readout`), once a human has approved
the first readout. Budget 40 minutes. The outcome is one page the Head of Product reads in five minutes.
Nothing is written to any data source.

---

## 1. Read where things stand

    hub task show <id>
    hub db list

Then `knowledge/definitions.md`, `knowledge/launches.md` and last week's readout. `hub db doctor <name>`
on each source; a failing one is the first line of the report.

## 2. Adoption per recent launch

For each launch in `knowledge/launches.md` shipped in the last 90 days: users who could use it (plan,
platform, flag), users who used it at least once, users who used it in two separate weeks. Adoption is
the share of eligible users, with the week-by-week trend since ship date.

## 3. Activation funnel

New signups in the last full week, through each step to the activation event in
`knowledge/definitions.md`. Show the step with the biggest drop and how it compares with the four-week
average.

## 4. Retention by cohort

Weekly signup cohorts for the last eight weeks: share active in week 1, 2, 4 and 8. Flag a cohort more
than five points off the average and say what was different about that week (a launch, a campaign, an
outage), as a possibility, not a cause.

## 5. What moved

Anything outside its normal range (beyond the last eight weeks' min and max). Check tracking first: a
drop to zero is usually a broken event. Put the checks you did on the line.

## 6. Write and hand over

Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-usage-readout.md` in the shape of `knowledge/examples/usage-readout.md`, with the
queries saved as `queries/YYYY-MM-DD-usage-readout.sql`. `hub files publish reports/YYYY-MM-DD-usage-readout.md`,
commit, and `hub task update <id> --status done --note`: the headline and the biggest caveat.
