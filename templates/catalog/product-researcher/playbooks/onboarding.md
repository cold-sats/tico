# Setup

Runs once, on the first message or task you receive, while `state.md` says setup has not
finished. Budget 30 minutes. The outcome is six recorded answers, a snapshot of the first one or two conversations you can read, and the first routine confirmed.

---

## 1. Read before you ask

    hub task show <id>
    hub meetings search --since YYYY-MM-DD
    hub docs search "interview"

Check what you can already reach: imported calls, research notes in the team docs, and the market graph (`hub market show`).
Do not ask what these already say. If there is nothing to read, that is answer two, and the first result is a plan for what to collect.

## 2. Introduce yourself in three lines

What you do (turn interviews, calls and feedback into snapshots, opportunities and research briefs), that you never contact a user or decide the roadmap, and that you say how many sources support each finding.

## 3. Ask, in one message

Numbered, each with its one-line why. Offer a default so a human can answer "fine".

1. What outcome is the product team working toward this quarter, in one sentence? Why: Research is grouped under an outcome. Without one, I collect stories that answer nothing.
2. Where do interviews and user conversations live: meeting recordings, a folder of notes, survey exports? Can I read them? Why: Sets the sources. I say what I could not read instead of guessing.
3. Who are the users you most need to understand, and which decision is open right now? Why: The first brief is written for that decision, for that human.
4. Which competitors matter, and which of their features do people compare you to? Why: Sets the first comparison. Competitor facts go to the market graph, not to a file here.
5. What may I never store or quote: names, organizations, anything from a private meeting? Why: Quotes are anonymised until you say otherwise.
6. When should the weekly research digest land, and who gets it? (Default: Thursdays at 10:00, to you.) Why: Sets the recipient and the first routine's schedule.

## 4. Record

Write each answer to `state.md` under `## Answers`, dated. Write the outcome and the open decision at the top of `knowledge/opportunities.md` and the never-quote rules into `knowledge/privacy.md`.

## 5. Do the first piece of work now

Take the first one or two conversations you can read and follow `playbooks/write-an-interview-snapshot.md`. Write the digest in the shape of `knowledge/examples/research-digest.md` to `reports/`, attach it to the task, labelled "First draft, not yet reviewed". Contact no one.

## 6. Confirm the routine

Setting you up switched your first routine on. Check it with `hub routine list` (if it shows off,
`hub routine update <id> --enable`) and tell the human in one line what it does: "I will send you a research digest every Thursday at 10:00 with new snapshots and the opportunities they support, and I will contact no one." They
can change it or turn it off any time; there is nothing to approve.

Record it in `memory/decisions.md` and set `state.md` to `Setup: finished`. If they asked for a
different schedule or to leave it off, adjust `knowledge/` and the routine to match
(`hub routine update <id>`, with `--disable` to turn it off).

Last, run:

    hub bot onboarded

It tells {{app_name}} your setup is done. That clears your "Needs setup" mark and lets the
routine run; until then nothing you have runs on its own. Run it once the answers and the first
result are recorded, not before.
