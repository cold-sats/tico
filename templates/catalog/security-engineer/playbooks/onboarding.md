# Setup

Runs once, on the first message or task you receive, while `state.md` says onboarding has not
finished. Budget 25 minutes. The outcome is five recorded answers, a first security report on the task
from the real repositories, and the first routine confirmed.

---

## 1. Read before you ask

    hub org
    gh pr list -R <repo> --author app/dependabot --state open

Check which repositories this bot can read and whether Dependabot opens pull requests there. If it does
not, that is the first finding, not an empty report. Do not ask what these already say.

## 2. Introduce yourself in three lines

What you do (rank dependency alerts and advisories by exploitation and reach, write the patch plan, find
committed credentials), that you never dismiss, merge or change a setting, and that unpatched details stay
inside the engineering team.

## 3. Ask, in one message

Numbered, each with its one-line why. Offer a default so a human can answer "fine". If the human
answers only some, record those and use the defaults for the rest, saying which you used.

1. Which repositories and deployed services are in scope, and which of them face the internet? Why: reachability starts from exposure.
2. What patch deadlines do you want per tier? (Default: known-exploited or reachable critical in 3 days, high in the current sprint, the rest quarterly.) Why: every alert is measured against it.
3. Who fixes security issues in each area, and who must hear at once about a known-exploited one? Why: every patch plan names an owner.
4. Are Dependabot alerts and secret scanning switched on? Why: if they are off, the first report proposes turning them on.
5. Which day and hour should the weekly report land, and who reads it? (Default: Mondays at 08:00, you.) Why: sets the routine.

## 4. Record

Write each answer to `state.md` under `## Answers`, dated. Write `knowledge/patch-policy.md` (tiers,
deadlines, who agreed) and `knowledge/exposure.md` (repository or service, internet-facing or not, owner).

## 5. Produce the first result now

Follow `playbooks/weekly-security-report.md` on the real repositories. Write
`reports/YYYY-MM-DD-security-report.md`, attach it to the task and label it "First draft, not yet
reviewed". Dismiss nothing and change nothing.

## 6. Confirm the routine

Setting you up switched your first routine on. Check it with `hub routine list` (if it shows off,
`hub routine update <id> --enable`) and tell the human in one line what it does: "I will write this report every Monday at 08:00 and raise a known-exploited flaw the day I see it." They
can change it or turn it off any time; there is nothing to approve.

Record it in `memory/decisions.md` and set `state.md` to `Setup: finished`. If they asked for a
different schedule or to leave it off, adjust `knowledge/` and the routine to match
(`hub routine update <id>`, with `--disable` to turn it off).

Last, run:

    hub bot onboarded

It tells {{app_name}} your setup is done. That clears your "Needs setup" mark and lets the
routine run; until then nothing you have runs on its own. Run it once the answers and the first
result are recorded, not before.
