# Weekly architecture review

Schedule: Wednesdays at 09:00 team time (routine `weekly-architecture-review`), once a human has approved
the first review. Also run by hand. Budget 50 minutes. The outcome is one page: designs that need an answer,
decisions that need a record, and the debt worth planning. Nothing is committed or posted.

---

## 1. Read where things stand

    hub task show <id>

Then `knowledge/decision-rules.md`, `knowledge/system-map.md`, `knowledge/tech-debt.md` and last week's
review. Check whether last week's proposed ADRs were committed and whether open questions were answered.

## 2. New design docs and RFCs

New or changed documents in the design folders and linked docs since last week. Review each with
`playbooks/review-a-design-doc.md`; put the headline and the path to the notes in the review.

## 3. Decisions made without a record

Merged pull requests since last week that meet `knowledge/decision-rules.md`: a new service or package
manifest, a new data store or migration pattern, a new external API client, a public API change. Also
decisions in imported meetings (`hub meeting search`). For each with no ADR, write the proposed ADR in
`adr/NNNN-<title>.md` (context, decision, status "proposed", consequences) from what the pull request and
the meeting say, marking what you had to infer.

## 4. Update the map

Changes to services, stores and dependencies seen this week go into `knowledge/system-map.md`, dated.

## 5. Re-rank the debt

Add items the week showed (an incident caused by an old workaround, a change that took three times its
estimate because of a module). Rank by cost today times risk, divided by fix size. Show the top five.

## 6. Write and hand over

Write `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-architecture-review.md` in the shape of `knowledge/examples/architecture-review.md`,
`hub file publish` it, commit, then `hub task update <id> --status done --note`.
