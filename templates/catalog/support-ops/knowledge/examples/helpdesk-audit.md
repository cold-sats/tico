# Acme help desk audit, Mon 2026-10-05

Sample output for Acme, a fictional studio-software company. Every rule, ticket and figure is
invented. Nothing has been changed in the help desk. First draft, not yet reviewed.

**Headline: one overlapping trigger sent 41 billing tickets to the general queue in September; removing it fixes most misroutes.**

## Findings (by tickets affected)
1. **Misroute, 41 tickets.** Trigger "Keyword: invoice" (added 2026-08-12) fires before "Billing
   form"; both match, the first wins and sends to General. Examples: T-2104, T-2119, T-2150.
   Change request CR-1.
2. **SLA policy looser than the promise.** Premium plan contract promises first reply in 2 business
   hours; the "Premium" SLA policy is 4 hours. 6 Premium tickets were answered in 2 to 4 hours and showed
   as on time. Change request CR-2. Decides: Dana (head of support).
3. **Stale macro, used 23 times.** "Refund window" says 14 days; the refund policy doc says 30 days
   since 2026-09-01 (Librarian answer 2026-10-05). Change request CR-3.
4. **Tags.** 3 near-duplicates (`refund`, `refunds`, `refund_request`: 212 tickets in total), 17 tags
   unused in 90 days. The September refunds report counts only `refund`. Change request CR-4.

## Change requests (each for approval on its own)
- **CR-1.** Admin, Triggers, "Keyword: invoice": deactivate. Check: send a test email with "invoice"
  in the subject; it should land in Billing. Undo: reactivate.
- **CR-2.** Admin, SLA policies, "Premium": first reply target 4h to 2h, business hours unchanged.
- **CR-3.** Macros, "Refund window": replace "within 14 days" with "within 30 days of purchase".
- **CR-4.** Merge `refunds` and `refund_request` into `refund`; update the refunds report filter first.

## Last month's changes
- The new-plan macro (applied 2026-09-08) was used 58 times; no QA flag against it.
