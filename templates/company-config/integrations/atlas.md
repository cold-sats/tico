## What it is

Acme's product database on MongoDB Atlas (M10, replica set): database `app`, read through a
database user that only holds the built-in `read` role. The generic rules are in
`hub tool show mongodb`.

## What data it has

| Collection | Fields worth knowing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts` | `_id, plan, region, created_at, email` | `email` is personal data: count and group, never list |
| `events` | `_id, account_id, type, at` | large; always filter on `at` |

`hub db atlas collections` lists them with a sample of their field names.

## How a bot uses it

```bash
hub db atlas collections
hub db atlas count accounts '{"plan": "team"}'
hub db atlas --query signups-since --param since=2026-09-01
hub tool query-search atlas signups
```

## Rules

- Read-only, always. No `$out`, `$merge` or JavaScript operators; never ask for a writer URL.
- Filter events by `at` and cap with `--limit`.
- Counts, plans and regions in reports, never the accounts' emails.

## Recipes

- Signups per region since a date: the `signups-by-region` named query.

## Gotchas

- Dates are UTC; pass `--param since=2026-09-01` and the tool sends a real date, not a string.
- A named query's values are literals: a value cannot add operators to the filter.

## Learnings

What bots and humans learn about this tool is added with `hub tool learn atlas "..."` and
shown under this page; a human folds it into the page over time. The page is the rule.
