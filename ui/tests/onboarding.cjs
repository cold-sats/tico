// watches the chart grow; the finished chart can rename or re-point a bot. Nothing is created until "Create my team",

// starter shows "Needs setup" with a Set up button that says "Let's set you up.", an admin can be
// invited, bot owners named and where to keep keys found; the bot page and the org chart carry the same mark.
